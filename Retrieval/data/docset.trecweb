If you are seeking a referral please do not post in this thread unless there are no offers for the card you need. Instead, click the name of someone worthy who is offering a referral and choose: Send a Private Message
If you wish to offer referrals, please read this entire Wikipost:
Quote:							FlyerTalk is not a marketplace and nothing is to be offered for sale or conditioned on an exchange of money or barter.			
		
Some credit card issuers conduct campaigns in which existing cardholders may earn a bonus by referring new applicants. This is the only thread in the Credit Card Programs forum where referral offers are permitted. Do not offer to refer in replies to other threads.
Post a full description of the offer (card issuer, card nationality, card type, spend requirement, bonus points, annual fee, etc.).
Do not post American Express offers in this thread. See HERE.
Do not post referral application links in any FlyerTalk post. Posts containing such links will be removed.
Do not post your email address or any inducement for others to choose your offer. Discuss the transaction through the PM system.
Do not post the same offer(s) more than once every 30 days. If a new or revised offer becomes available during those 30 days you may post again, but please also click the Alert icon on your earlier post and the moderator will remove it to avoid confusion.
Use this site to see if you are able to offer referrals for cards issued by JP Morgan Chase: https://www.chasereferafriend.com
If you have questions or concerns please click the triangular link in the lower left corner of post #1. Please do not post a reply to the thread.

Chase Freedom Card Offer
 / icon and title 
 message 
			
			Chase Freedom Card is a no annual fee credit card that offers 5% back in rotating categories.  Currently, the card is paying 5% back on gas for 6 months of the year.  You can earn ultimate reward points, or cash back on your statement.  The current offer is for a bonus of $100 after spending $500.  
Referrers get $50 for each approved application.  Once you have the card, you can become a referrer too.  
This is a great starter card because it has no annual fee and it allows you to earn Ultimate Reward Points which are valuable for travel.  
PM me for a referral link.

It's 2x dining and travel. (3x dining on first friday of the month, plan romantic dinners accordingly)
And there's all the UR mall bonuses, but that's with any UR card.

			This thread is meant to list all current special credit card offers for airlines and hotel program and provide names of non-airline/hotel programs. This will help those who would like to apply for only special offers without going to each forum. If you subscribe to this thread (Thread Tools > Subscribe to this Thread > Notification Type), you will see this thread bolded in blue when you check your subscriptions (Quick Links - Subscribed threads). Click the small icon (with a small down arrow) next the title of the thread and it will take you to the first post that you have not read. This way, once you subscribe to this thread and someone posts a link to a good offer, you will know of it.
This is meant to be a community based effort. There are so many offers going around that it is impossible for me to keep track of all of them or visit each forum to find special offers.  So people who find special offers or come to know of major updates to existing offers should send me a PM. I will then contact the mods to open the thread and make a post.
The reason this thread is closed is because posters were discussing specifics of various offers. Since this thread is a generic thread not devoted to a specific offer, it becomes a waste of time to read the thread. For example if you are interested in the value or use of Virgin Atlantic miles, this is not the thread to discuss that as many people have no interest in VS miles. Such discussion should be in the VS thread. If you see this thread open, it is because I have contacted the mods to open the thread so I can make updates. There is a time gap while they keep it open and I make the updates, so please do not use that opportunity to ask question about a specific offer.
This thread will only be for US credit cards. There are threads for Canada & UK:
Milesbuzz:  Canada
http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/credi...solidated.html
These are following types of offers I am looking for:
1. Special offers from existing cards - e.g., 100K BA
2. Special transfer promos such as Amex to DL/BA bonus or hotel points to US bonus (many FTers use SPG as their main credit card, so its like transfering credit card miles to US)
3. New credit card announcements e.g., The Ritz Carlton or the Hyatt.
4. The only exception would be companies that issue DL or HH. They have frequent specials and there are dedicated threads for them maintained by PainCorp and michael_v. Please send them any special offers or post in those threads. However if some non-HH/DL product has some transfer special (e.g., TYP - HH) please let me know in addition to PainCorp/Michael_v
When posting offers, if possible please provide the FT discussion links and the deadline for the offer, if any.
The most recent offers to be posted to this thread will be highlighted in maroon.

List of non-Airline/Hotel Programs
 / icon and title 
 message 
			
			I will use this post to list non-airline/hotel programs and provide links to useful threads discussing these programs. The reason I don't have such a list for airlines and hotels is that almost all major airlines and hotels have their own credit card that can be easily seen on their websites. Also there is a dedicated forum for them. By compiling a list we will be aware of all the possible non-airline/hotel programs available.
I won't be putting links to standard offers for these programs. If a special offer comes up, I shall add them to the OP. I recently switched my main secondary card to Bank of America and would have done it earlier if I knew such a product existed. If you know of more programs or of more useful threads, please send me a PM and I will add it here.

The reason I thot Amex was special was that it normally gives 10K and does not waive fees, so I thot it was a special. Plus the partnership with CO will be ending.

Better then 50K with fee waived? I was about to pull the trigger on that one.  Maybe I'll wait...

Agreed, but add hotels too. The 80k for Priority Club is one off the top of my head.

Is it still open, and if yes, is it targeted?

The 75 & 100K Citi AA's (The "expired" 100K's & 75/$1500 are still working for people.)
The 50K+FreeNight Marriott
AmTrak 30K no fee (transferable to CO after $200 AmTrak purchase or 3 RT AmTrak in NE US, no fee ever).
Southwest Free RT plus $500
Southwest 2 Free RT's
Hyatt 2 Free Nights AnywhereSmart way to get the CO is wait until Feb.1 Mileathon (to get extra 4K), apply for the 25/5 + $50, call in to get additional 25K as adjustment, = 59K+$50.

			Don't count on a 25k adjustment if you have gotten the 5k from the extra card, the supervisor mentioned an additional 20k (I opened with 25k) because she knew I got 30k.
Perhaps if you get the extra card after the 25k upgrade.

			Does Chase still limit folks to 1 new card per 6 months? If so, people interested in the Continental, United, Southwest, British Air, Marriott, and/or Hyatt cards will need to decide on just one for now.

 End AdSlot 13
Welcome!
You've found one of the best resources in the travel world for information on earning miles, points, and perks from credit cards.
There is an incredible amount of knowledge here, curated from years of experience in chasing travel goals.  The purpose of this thread is to point you in the direction of the information most likely to help you, where ever you are in that journey.The references in this thread are only to the most popular, recent discussions.  We encourage you to use the "Search this Forum" link to uncover additional threads about less popular topics or offers before posting.General Advice
One of the bedrock cultural preferences of this community is to encourage each person to commit to researching and learning about the various elements of this hobby and then asking questions.  In other words, somewhere in this forum is the answer you seek but - because there are so many nuances and details to these offers - the process of finding your own answers will help you build your own instinct in crafting your personal strategy.  However, if you become frustrated, do not hesitate to ask.  We would rather have too many questions than too few!
If you invest the time in searching and reading, yet your question is still not answered, you'll usually have the best results posting your question in a recently active thread on a closely related topic, rather than creating a new thread.  One noteworthy exception: If you are developing a personal application strategy that is not already covered by a destination-related thread, you may create your own thread in the Credit Card Programs forum.  Preferably, the first post in that thread would outline the details of your own travel goals, review the research you've already completed, and suggest a possible draft strategy for the community's comments.

Which Forums Relate to Credit Card Topics?
 / icon and title

Where should I search or post for answers?
There are seven different places to look, depending on your exact question:
Credit Card Programs
The general forum for questions related to credit cards that earn miles, points, and other perks.  If your question does not fit anywhere else, bring it here.
American Express | Membership Rewards
The place for discussion on all cards issued directly by American Express, including Membership Rewards and cashback cards.  Exceptions: All Hilton branded cards are discussed in the Citi | ThankYou Rewards forum; cards issued by other banks but using the Amex network are discussed in the Credit Card Programs forum.
Chase | Ultimate Rewards
Threads relating to all cards that earn Chase Ultimate Rewards points, as well as most Chase co-branded airline and hotel cards, belong here.  Notable exceptions: Hyatt and Southwest card discussion happens within those programs' own forums.
Citi | ThankYou Rewards
Conversations regarding Citi products that earn ThankYou Points, as well as other proprietary points systems managed by Citi and co-branded miles/points products. In particular, this includes Citi-issued American Airlines cards, as well as all Hilton HHonors cards (both Citi and Amex versions).
Diners Club | Club Rewards
Discussions regarding the current state of the Diners Club system and point transfers live here.
Manufactured Spending
Any and all discussion about creative ways to boost the total volume of credit card spending, in order to meet minimum spending requirements, boost point balances, or unlock high-spend benefits should be held here.
MilesBuzz
Promotions, third-party points, and other ways to earn free travel that are not tied directly to credit cards are discussed here.  Examples: Checking account rewards, shopping portal bonuses, social media check-ins...
Each program's own forum
If you have questions or insight regarding using the actual miles or points themselves, or experiences with an airline or hotel group's service, your best resources will likely be found within that program's own forum on FlyerTalk.  In other words, if the topic is not specifically about a credit card, it's usually better to post in a specific program's forum.

http://milecards.com/6102/50000-mile...d-first-class/Is domestic first class within the U.S. really only 35,000 miles? Tried Lufthansa's mileage calculator / map linked from the page above and it seems to say that for all the 2 cabin first class routes in the U.S (seems they charge it at the business class rate).

			There's another offer for this card out there, with a lower spending requirement ($2500 in 3 months):
https://www.barclaycardus.com/app/ja...13&legacy=trueHowever, that one (unlike the new one) looks like it does have the lower signup bonus for the Platinum card, if you're approved for that one.

 message 						First LH 50k offer I have ever seen in last two years.  Looks like Barclays is being a little more agressive since the the US-AA merger announcement.  Does LH Miles & Mores  still have a short short shelf life........36 months?

 message 						Like most American travelers, I know next to nothing about the Lufthansa frequent flyer program.  Is there anything "interesting" that can be done with 50,000 miles?  Otherwise, I think I'll save my Barclay's apps for their pretty lucrative cash rebates (like with the NFL card and that new product) and, of course, the annual churn of the US Airways card (before it goes away).

Ya I don't know about Lufthansa frequent flyer program, and how it works. Would love to hear from those who know how valuable this 50K offer actually is?

But what I am trying to figure out is if their award map calculator is right and it's only 35k for domestic first on United which is a great deal.I would normally not redeem my United miles for domestic first...but if it's part of an orphan bonus offer from a non-core bank, then it's a good option for me.

If Barclays throws the bloggers a bone I would say you will get more than enought info on LH.  I personally hope they do

I would cautiously tend to believe their published award chart over the calculator.  Domestic J shows there as being 55,000 miles:

Got to be better use though then travel in the US. Wait are there fuel charges on Lufthansa?

And that is the mystery. 'Domestic' is one country (bottom of that chart). So theoretically like the Europe/Europe is for say Germany -- France the North America/North America is for say US--Canada. 
Wish someone has redeemed these here...but I guess the intro bonus is essentially 55k with the spend so a J ticket either way.

			I did a bit of an analysis what you can do with Miles&More miles a while ago - this may be relevant.
- You can book one-way awards or round-trip.
- You can book LH group tickets online - you will need to call for partners.
-  US domestic awards are the same price as United Mileage Plus, that's 25,000 miles in Y and $2.50 per segment
- US to Hawaii in Y is 40,000 miles and minimal taxes/fees
- Domestic First Class (books as business class for LH) is 35,000 miles and minimal taxes/fees
- US residents pay just 50k miles for a Round-Trip to Europe in Economy. If you manage to find seats on US Airways or LOT there are no fuel surcharges! Otherwise it's $300++.
- the Middle East/ Northern Africa zone is pretty huge at Miles &amp; More (interestingly Turkey is not in the region but in Europe!), now that Ethiopian Airlines has joined you can fly from West Africa all the way into Dubai in a one region award 
- take a good look at the 3 region awards, they apply for any flights crossing the Atlantic but not the Pacific, for example HKG-FRA-SFO would be considered a 3 region award at Miles &amp; More. Why is this good value? Well find the longest 4 segment one-way and a place where there are no fuel surcharges (Brazil!) and route from Brazil to Europe to Australia
- Miles &amp; More has excellent availability for Lufthansa's A380 in First Class 330 days out. Often 2 seats are released at once with more to follow. Availability is the same as it used to be for partners several years ago. 
- I confirmed all mileage requirements with the LH call center. Also availability seemed the same as on united.com.
- you can book LH group redemptions online and for partners you will need to call, agents are generally pretty knowledgeable

Good point.  I completely missed that block at the bottom.

US Domestic First Class is 17,000 miles one-way and 35,000 RT. Just spoke to M&M Call Center in Singapore. My test was JFK-LAX in UA F (booked as Business Class).

The original, pre-2016, thread can be found here: USA EMV cards: Availability, experiences, Q&A (Chip & PIN -or- Chip & Signature)  The thread was split to make searching less onerous.EMV wikipost volunteers: kebosabiWhat is EMV?
EMV is a defacto global standard of technology where there is a visible microchip on the front of the card. It looks like this:Who issues them?
See Google Docs spreadsheet in Post #1
SFOAMS also has created a list of excellent webpage that shows US EMV cards in a more interactive interface
Another site, which lets you narrow the search for an EMV card by various parameters, is http://www.spotterswiki.com/emv/index.php.Several credit unions issue some form of Chip-and-PIN credit cards or prepaid cards. Prepaid EMV cards however are not recommended due to junk fees. USAA (currently restricted to members of military) used to offer Chip-and-PIN cards, but as late has backtracked to Chip-and-Signature priority. Hey that's a cool Google Docs list! I know others that aren't on that list. How can I help by adding them to the list?
My bad for not putting this into the wiki sooner. Right now, the Google Docs is locked out of editing and only in "read-only" view because there were instances in the past where people would just delete the rows not thinking that it affects others viewing the list.
If you promise not to delete any rows and input all the pertinent info (annual fee, rewards, FTF, etc.), I can provide you with edit access. Just shoot me a PM to kebosabi with your gmail address and I'll provide you edit access.
Thanks for helping out!As of October 2014, no USA-based card issuer offers Chip-and-PIN priority cards except for BMO Harris (Diners Club) and UN Federal Credit Union.  Other major USA-based banks such as BofA, Chase, Citi, as well as others issue Chip-and-Signature cards which may work at many automated kiosks. However, bear in mind the word may is used above is a context where there is no absolute certainty of success for certain environments such as automated kiosks due to different natures of offline and online transactions. It is highly recommended to read Post #3 which lists real life FTer examples on how Chip-and-Signature worked and did not work at various transaction environments. Can I upgrade it right now?
If it's listed on that Google Docs spreadsheet or SFOAMS' Silk page, wouldn't hurt to call/twitter them for a free upgrade. If you get the response you don't like, hang up, try again. What is the difference between Chip-and-Signature and Chip-and-PIN?
You insert the chipped card into the slot. The physical contact terminal will read the EMV chip and the terminal will automatically read the preferred cardholder verification methods (called CVM) for that card. 
Chip-and-Signature means that the terminal will printout a receipt for you to sign. This is the most prevalent authentication for most US issued EMV cards. Chip-and-Signature helps in a way that it will get through to face-to-face merchant transactions where you and the merchant do not speak the same language. 
Chip-and-PIN means that the terminal will prompt you to input a PIN for authentication. Some credit union issued credit cards will have this CVM as secondary if Chip-and-Signature cannot be done. Chip-and-PIN is the more prevalent method of authentication used outside the US, especially in transaction environments where no human interaction is needed (i.e. automated gas pumps, toll roads, train kiosks, etc.). 
The Google Docs spreadsheet will list which CVM are used in the EMV cards listed. Some cards can only do Chip-and-Signature. Other cards can do both Chip-and-Signature and Chip-and-PIN. And others might have a third option called No CVM (no authentication needed) which is reserved for low value transactions. 
One chip can hold a lot more data, therefore it is capable of doing multiple verification methods. That's one of the great things about EMV over the mag-stripe which can hold very little data. 
I want to know for sure what my EMV chip does. Is there anyway I can test out my own EMV card to see what the CVM list is?
alexmt has written up a nice step-by-step procedure on Post #3615.If most of the EMV cards in the US is the Chip-and-Signature type, doesn't that mean it's still useless abroad?
Depends if you see it as glass half empty or glass half full. See Post #3 for further details on how Chip-and-Signature has worked both successfully and unsuccessfully depending on the merchant transaction environment and use your best judgment whether which one is right for you. 
Are there any places in the US that are accepting transactions via the EMV chip?
tmiw has created a dedicated Google maps webpage to show where EMV has been proven to work here: http://emvacceptedhere.com/  Per his Post #4240, feel free to add any places with active EMV terminals if you come across one.
As of 2014/05, the EMV terminals in most Walmarts and Sam's Clubs are being turned on. Hence, the best place to try them out would be your local Walmart or Sam's Club. For other merchants, it's slowly being phased in. I hope people will post them in the Post your receipt of your 1st EMV based transaction in the US thread. cvarming has shown us an EMV transaction receipt from Brooklyn, NY in Post #2380. I myself had my first EMV based (Chip-and-Signature) transaction in two stores in the Los Angeles area, as shown in detail in Post #2705 (courtesy of WhatWhatTech for pointing these two stores out)I don't want a chip in my card. I heard horror stories all over the media saying hackers can steal my credit card info from a mile away.
There are two types of chips. One is contactless and the other is contact. Cards can be either one or the other, or both. 
In the Google Docs spreadsheet, the cards that are capable of contactless payments are listed seperately under the "RFID or NFC contactless chip" column. If it says yes, then that means it has the ability to do contactless payments. If it says no, it doesn't have that feature. 
The one that the media has overhyped about hackers "stealing your information wirelessly" was the contactless type like this:
You are worried about this happening, right?
You don't have to worry. EMV is a chip standard that can have both contact and contactless interfaces.  With the traditional contact interface, this means you actually have to physically insert the chip into a POS terminal for it to be authorized, like this:
With the contact interface, nothing is wireless. No data is sent out in a stand-alone contact type EMV chip.  With the EMV contactless interface, data is sent wirelessly.   
Furthermore, contactless chip cards are required to show a symbol (looks like Wi-Fi symbol) somewhere on the card that to denote it's capability as a contactless card. For example, here's an example of a Discover Card with contactless capability (in which Discover calls "Discover ZIP") showing the contactless symbol on the back of the card:
Don't believe everything that the media says. Besides, millions of people all over the world from London to Singapore, uses contactless payments daily in extremely crowded subways and mass transit with nary any problems. There are multiple layers of encrypted securities and keys that are needed to break the code. Frankly, giving your physical card to a waiter/waitress who takes the card out of your view is much more susceptible to fraud than contactless payments.Why should I care?
If you are an international traveler, you will want this because majority of the world has or in the process of converting to this payment format. 
In fact, in 2012, even North Korea moved to the EMV format, leaving the US as one of the countries in the world that hasn't done so. 
In addition, VISA, MC, AMEX, and Discover have all agreed to incentivize the USA shifting to EMV payments by 2015 by shifting liability for fraudulent transactions to merchants if they do not have EMV equipment and the cardholder has an EMV card. So if you travel internationally or would like to get one before the others, you might be interested in getting one.
BS! I had no problems using my card in [insert whereever country], [insert whatever point in time]
If you stick to the tourist path where they have lots of visitors from the US, you should have no problems using your mag-stripe only card in hotels and restaurants, at least for now. But as things can change as things go forward. However, consider that once you start taking the off-beaten path, go to non-touristy places where they are not familiar with mag-stripes, rent a car and use toll roads, fill up gas, or try to buy train tickets you might end up into a trouble of the machine not recognizing your card because it lacks the chip. Furthermore, a lot of toll roads, gas pumps, and automated ticket machines lack any human assistance to help you when you need it the most.  But [insert credit card company] told me all merchants that display their logo must accept them! All I have to do is report them for violating their agreements, right?
There are several factors against this.
1. You can only speak English. The merchant representative, most likely a part-time clerk earning minimum wage, speaks in a different language, let's say French. If you have no French language skills, how are you going to get your point across? Are you going to whip out your cell phone at exorbitant int'l roaming charges and hope the customer service is going to translate it for you on the spot? Or maybe you might actually know French. But how about Swahili, Farsi, Balinese, or the multiple languages in mainland China? 
2. Just like US, the rest of the world's businesses uses part-time minimum wage workers as cashiers to cut down on labor costs. Most of their SOP training manuals are written by MBA types to not to do anything they are not familiar with. Do not expect them to understand the intricate details of credit card mumbo jumbo. You don't expect Taco Bell employees to understand the minute details of Discover-JCB-Union Pay agreements, right? Same thing the other way around: be respectful as a guest in their country, prepare in advance in their ways, avoid being an "ugly American" stereotype. 
3. You are a guest in their country. You are a minority. If 99.9% of their country's people and other tourists from around the world uses EMV, do you really think they are going to accomodate the 0.1% of American tourists who only have mag-stripes credit cards? 
4. Again, you are a guest in their country. How would you, as an American standing in line, react if a Chinese tourist was clogging up the lines at a local Taco Bell because the clerk doesn't understand the Discover-Union Pay agreement and has trouble communicating between Mandarin spoken by the tourist and English spoken by the Taco Bell clerk? Same way the other way around. You do not want to clog up the lines for everyone. The less hassle, the better.
5. VISA and MC make tons of money from merchants in that country. Say SNCF French Rail. It's a billion dollar company in France. Do you think VISA is going to pull the plug of their relationship with SNCF because SNCF refuses to do mag-stripe processing at their unmanned train station kiosk? Of course not. Be realistic.6. And lastly, if you're up against an unstaffed toll kiosk, gas pump or train ticket machine, are you going to yell curses at the machine? But I want my credit card to be able to be used in the US too!
No worries. They have not gotten rid of the mag-stripe on the back of the card for backward compatibility reasons, just like we still have embossed numbers on our cards for backwards compatibility to using those old carbon copy imprinters. 
[insert own Hyatt card image front and back together with red arrows pointing to all the backward compatibility features]
You use the chip on the front of the card abroad (for now), and the mag-stripe just like any other card for the US. Basically, you're increasing your credit card's acceptance rate by getting a card that both via the chip and the mag-stripe. You're getting a better deal for free.
And when 2015 comes along and US switches to EMV, you'll be way ahead of everyone else too!
So why did the rest of the world and the US moved/moving toward EMV?
Primarily, due to fraud concerns. You see, the mag-stripe has been with us since the 1950s. It may have been the most high tech thing back in the day, but with the technology that is available today, any shmo can pick up a $100 USB magnetic card skimming device off of eBay and get your credit card info. 
And unlike skimming off contactless cards which actually need the person to have l33t programming skills, skimming off a magnetic stripe has become so ubiquitous that nary a day goes about skimming fraud going on somewhere in America, from gas pumps, Michael's stores (2011), Target breaches (2013), restaurant waiters/waitresses, to even McDonald's drive thrus.
https://www.google.com/search?q=skimming+fraud
These type of fraud used to be prevalent in Europe. But once they started switching over to EMV starting over 2 decades ago, this type of fraud went elsewhere. It went over to Asia, Canada and Mexico, Latin America, etc. etc. until they too began implementing EMV to combat skimming fraud. The US is practically the only country left that hasn't done so, therefore all the fraud that used to take place elsewhere is now happening here. 
But EMV is old and it's not fool proof. Shouldn't we just skip over it and do something new instead?
Yes, EMV is old. It was developed in the 1990s and its smart card payment predecessor was first introduced in France. But as of today, it has become the defacto global standard of payments. 
But then, what else is there? There is no other de facto global standard of payments alternative. For example, if we decide to skip over it and do something new, hypothetically like DNA matching technology, it still means US int'l travelers will continue to have problems abroad with useless plastic acceptance because no other country is using this DNA matching technology except the US. 
Besides, nothing is fool proof. You can say that the bank vault isn't fool proof because you can crack it open if enough C4 is used. But your average low-life scumbag isn't likely to get military grade C4 easily either. But the bank vault does make it harder to get the bank's money over say a petty cash box. That's the point here. EMV is akin to a security tight bank vault, the old mag-stripe is akin to a petty cash box lying around inside the drawer.
I'm a business owner and I don't think EMV is going to take off. I'm not going to spend extra hundreds of dollars to upgrade my credit card machine. Convince me other wise why I should.
I can understand the added extra cost to your business once this switchover takes place. But before even saying that, look at your existing POS terminal. Does it have a slot somewhere to insert a card?
Most likely, if you had replaced your POS terminal within the past five years, you already have an EMV capable terminal. EMV is basically just not turned on yet from the processor and acquirer side. 
If you have an EMV capable terminal, then a best bet would be to contact your acquirer to have the EMV feature turned on. You did your end of the deal already by having an EMV capable terminal, it is now the acquirers' responsibility to turn it on in accordance to the EMV switchover mandate.
And if you don't, you are going to replace your POS terminal anyway from common wear and tear. It isn't a hard switch-over. You can continue to use your POS terminal until it dies out because EMV cardholders will still have the mag-stripe on the back. And by the time your non-EMV capable POS terminal is up for replacement the market will be full with these newer POS terminals that can accept the mag-stripe, EMV, as well as contactless payments.
In addition, you may also want to check with your acquirer or processor about EMV capable terminals. Some of them are willing to replace your terminal for free in preparation for the US EMV switchover. Call and ask for details.
But what's in it for me? I'm the one that has to pay for the upgrade.
All the major card networks have given incentives for merchants for the upcoming EMV switchover. 
If 75% or more of your credit card transactions are done on an EMV contact and contactless terminal, they are going to waive your annual PCI-DSS fees, which usually costs you around $5.00-$19.95/month per terminal. The overall long term cost savings of those compliance fees will be larger than the cost of an one time upgrade for the terminal. The downside is that once EMV switchover happens and if you do not have a POS terminal that is able to accept EMV, the fraud liability shifts over to the merchant. I own several fast food franchises. If I upgrade my POS terminals at all of my restaurants, it's going to cost me thousands, if not millions. I don't think anyone is going to use a fake credit card to buy $5 burgers. And if they do, wouldn't it be cheaper for me to eat the fraud cost?
Remember also that fraud isn't just committed by dishonest customers using fraudulent cards. Fraud can also happen with dishonest employees skimming off credit card data from the mag-stripe as in the case of a teenage McDonald's drive thru employee skimming off $13,000 of customers' credit cards in Olympia, WA. Consider the public relations fall out that your business may have if this happens (i.e. the big Target breach of 2013, where someone used a mag stripe card to load malware INTO Target's system). Is it worth risking to take such a huge PR disaster?

Online PIN is on the card, just below offline PIN on the CVM list. While having online PIN first would make things like PIN changes more convenient, offline PIN first is probably better for card acceptance; some terminals outside the US are apparently badly misconfigured and will try online PIN despite not supporting it.

It was a lightning fast transaction so I suspected it was offline pin, then the receipt confirmed it.

There's not much of a difference in transaction times (or not supposed to be anyway). Still, CVS is nice for showing exactly the CVM used on the receipt.

My point is that unless the place has CMV waiver, offline pin requires a signature for small transactions, whereas online pin would be ... well ... PIN!

Actually you can't always count on the on screen prompt either. As mentioned before, I've seen swipe or insert prompts at Vons (Safeway) both on terminals with chip slots (where inserting did nothing) and on terminals that don't even have chip slots.
Most of the time it's a good indicator though.

If both PIN CVMs are supported by the terminal and the card's a MasterCard, PIN should be getting asked for if either one is at the top of the CVM list regardless of the transaction amount. Merchants are allowed to suppress the prompt for small amounts if it's a card from one of the other three brands. Signature would only be asked for if online PIN isn't supported but offline PIN is (and the latter is ranked lower than signature or is not on there at all).

UN and First Tech Visa Debit have no offline PIN. Up pops the signature slip ...

 message 						So the HSBC Debit MasterCard is not only EMV contactless  but also is offline PIN preferring on the common AID. It also supports online PIN before signature and no CVM is last. It also supports PIN changes with issuer scripts (tested at Walmart). Very good US alternative to the revolt card with Contactless!

But what about on the global AID? Who really cares about the common AID since it isn't used outside the US.

My experience has been with American debit cards that have online pins on the credit network, but no offline pins. So, an offline POS, being unable to verify the PIN via chip, forces a signature. You could try explaining why that isn't so if you'd like.

No, that's completely correct. However, let's look back at some of what you said.
CMV is cytomegalovirus. I don't know what that has to do with EMV, but you can't waive a virus. Nasty virus in infants, too. CVM waiver has nothing to do with whether offline PIN works or not but I understand what you're getting at now.
But yes, this makes perfect sense what you just said - I just don't think you quite understand how CVM list parsing works. Cards pick what CVM is used, as long as the terminal supports it. CVS probably supports both online and offline PIN (I would imagine). Thus, if the card prefers offline PIN, offline will be used - if it prefers online, then online will be used.
Just because offline PIN was used doesn't mean CVS doesn't support online PIN, it just means the card preferred offline.

See also, this thread in the US Airways forum:
New AAdvantage Aviator Silver and Red Cards from BarclayCard (US targeted)
Differences between Red and Silver card
Any Aviator cardholders always had the option to upgrade to Silver. You just had to call Barclaycard and pay the $195 annual fee. Beyond that, there's nothing "exclusive" about it.
In short, it depends on if the extra $100/year annual fee the silver card has over the red is justified by the following benefits the silver card has over the red:    5000 EQM after $20k annual spend    Companion certificate after $30k annual spend    Another 5000 EQM after $40k annual spend    3 miles per dollar charged on AA purchases
    Global entry reimbursement

 message 						I pushed on this issue yesterday and spoke to a manager. She told me that they didn't anticipate being able to offer upgrades until May at the earliest. Having said that, there seems to be wide variability in the information provided by the CSRs.  The first person I asked about an upgrade told me to "call the airline because they manage the rewards program"

			I received my Barclays Aviator Red World MasterCard yesterday and was able to set the pin while unblocking the card. This product is a true EMV Chip + Pin card. The card number and CVV code remained the exact same as my US Airways card which it replaced. Interesting is on the back of the card I noticed the date the plastic was made was  10/14 so Barclays has had these for quite sometime just waiting for AA to merge the US Airways program together with AAdvantage.While I was online with customer service, I inquired about upgrading my Aviators Red Card to the Aviators Silver Card. After a brief hold the CS representative came back and stated that at this time they could not upgrade me. After further inquiring as to the qualifications, I was told that my CL was high enough (Credit Line on my account $25K), my account was in good standing as well. The only thing she could see was that I had not spent over $30k in one year. When I mentioned that I have spent about $15k since I opened the card in November of 2014 she said to try back again once I passed the $30k spend threshold. I would be curious if anyone with over $30k spend that has a Red card is able to convert it to Silver.

That is interesting since I asked about this while I was asking about getting my new aviator expedited and I spoke with a "specialist" who said they were planning to get offers out soon, but she simply didn't see any offers available on my account. I do expect that the offers are put on the account after the 30k threshold which qualifies you for world elite on red or silver.

That's a little frustrating since the whole reason I want the Silver card in the first place is so I can START putting that kind of spend on it in order to get the EQM bonus. Right now I'm working towards $40k on my Citi Exec card for that card's 10k EQM, but unless they are going to retroactively apply all that Red spend to Silver bonuses I don't think I'd want to take the chance that I wouldn't end up being upgraded ultimately.

 message 						I sent an email via Barclays customer service on their website requesting an upgrade from the Red Aviator to the Silver Aviator. I explained the reasoning behind my request mentioning specific points and benefits that the Silver card has over the Red card. I'm keeping my fingers crossed but honestly don't expect a positive result since they seem to still be in transition. Hopefully they see all the times I have requested the upgrade to Silver and hope that "the squeaky wheel get the oil"!

Seems there's a lot of mixed messages coming out of CS. I just got my Aviator Red and called into make sure I can use it since I got a fraud alert on a big purchase yesterday and there was some confusion around activating my new card. I talked to a couple reps today and they said no changes can be made to Aviators until July, neither world elite upgrades or silver upgrade or the like. But they did say I would get the option to upgrade to silver in July, when they plan put offers on accounts, but that I can't do it until then. I guess I'll hold them to that in July.

I just got this response from CS;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you for contacting us regarding your AAdvantage Aviator Red World MasterCard. We can certainly address your inquiry regarding the upgrade on your account.
We are pleased to know that you are interested with upgrading your account to the Aadvantage Aviator Silver World Elite MasterCard product. At this time, we do not have a specific date as to when the product will be available for your account. Rest assured, it will happen when the merger with American Airlines will be complete. Barclaycard and US Airways are committed to keeping our customers informed if there are any changes in the future. For the most updated information on our proposed merger please visit www.usairways.com/arriving.
Nonetheless, we are now looking forward to our continuing partnership with the New American. While we do not have details of the new benefits that will added towards your account upon the merger, we would like to set your expectation that new benefits will be available once the frequent flyer programs merge this year. The benefits that have been established as of the moment are as follows:- 10% of miles back when you redeem your miles for award travel- 25% off in flight purchases on food, beverages and headsets. Savings will appear as statement credits.- $100 flight discount (after $30,000 in spend)- Additional redemption flexibility for one-way travel and first class upgrades
- Priority Group 1 Boarding on American Airlines operated flights
We hope you find this information helpful. If you have any other questions and concerns, please reply to this message. 
Sincerely,
Customer Care

Yeah, The CS people I spoke to mentioned end of June, starting July as when the merger is scheduled to be complete. All that falls in line with what they told me.

			Here is my exchange with CS:Me:I continue to be frustrated about the lack of and/or inconsistent information regarding upgrades from the Red to the Silver Card. I would appreciate clear answers to the following questions:1) will spending on the Red card count toward the EQM bonus if the card is upgraded prior to the end of the year?2) will the Silver card become available to everyone at some point or will there be credit limit, spend history or other criteria?3) will it be possible to defer annual fee renewal charges until a decision on Silver upgrade has been made (I am reluctant to pay an annual fee if I won't be able to upgrade)?
Thank you.

... We can certainly address your request regarding the upgrade on your account.
At this time, our current policy prevents us from upgrading or replacing your account. New federal regulations place certain restrictions on product changes and we are currently working hard towards meeting these requirements. If an offer becomes available, we will notify you directly. We also apologize for any inconvenience this may cause...

Thank you. 
Reply:
... We can certainly address your request regarding the upgrade on your account.
At this time, our current policy prevents us from upgrading or replacing your account. New federal regulations place certain restrictions on product changes and we are currently working hard towards meeting these requirements. If an offer becomes available, we will notify you directly. We also apologize for any inconvenience this may cause...
"Federal Regulations"?
as far as spending towards EQM, a CS told me when I asked about that earlier that the spend does carry over. 
That line about federal regulations seems to be along the lines of :
http://ficoforums.myfico.com/t5/Cred...s/td-p/1192727
But he might mean more generally that because of concern for this type of thing, the policy at Barclays is to disallow changes until the merger is complete and all cards have been transitioned, to avoid any missteps in the regulations from the CARD act.

=======================================
A few people in the Alaska Airlines forum have in the past received personally targeted, single-use links for a 50k offer when they opt-in to "Partner Offers" in their Mileage Plan account preferences.
25k mile offer + $100 SC after $1k spend in 3mo, $75 AF (NOT waived 1st yr): https://secure.bankofamerica.com/app...aignid=2110445 Dead 6/1/15.
25k mile offer, $75 AF but $100 statement credit after $1k spend in 3mo: https://www.applyonlinenow.com/USCCa...ry?sc=VAB6CK#b
30K mile offer, $75 AF (NOT waived 1st yr): https://www.applyonlinenow.com/USCCa...ry?sc=VAB2OX#b
40K mile offer ($10K spend in 6 months), $75 AF (NOT waived 1st yr): https://www.applyonlinenow.com/USCCa...ry?sc=VAB2SY#b  Hat tip to HACK MY TRIP

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When do the initial bonus miles post?  For most people they post before they even get the card or shortly after approval If there's a statement credit, when does it post?
 It seems to be batch-processed.  It will post automatically. Can be on the same statement or the next statement. It does not appear to be based on the statement close date.

I think BofA takes forever to do any matching and from what I've read they seldom match at all. I guess it really boils down to how nice the rep is.

Same as always. Also important to note that if you're not approved for the Signature, they could give you the other two, and their sign-up bonuses are much lower.

 Good point. While the bonus  is 30,000 miles for Signature accounts, it is only 10,000 miles for Platinum Plus accounts, and 8,000 miles for Preferred accounts.

			This is the first card I have seen so far (I am relatively new to this, of course) that has a $99 companion certificate issued without a spend requirement nor having to wait until your first anniversary - this says if you get the Visa Sig version of the card you'll get your 30K miles and your $99 companion cert. upon approval (1-2 wks for the 30K miles). That is quite nice.
 It also has a vague reference to Alaska Airlines Boardroom Passes, but I"m not sure whether this is an added free perk to the card, or what.
Now I must research whether these are transferable miles, and/or whether I have the ability to utilize this airline. 
edit - I see, I cannot transfer these out to other programs by the looks of it (aside from via points.com, of course) but I CAN use the miles on AA or DL. It also says I can EARN elite qualifying miles with AS when I fly on AA or DL... now I am curious whether I must do something special in order to make the miles post.. whether I will get miles for both AA and AS when I fly on AA, etc. FT : Educating THrough Encouraging Research  .. ETHER... whoa man, deep. :P

Yes, got a 2nd card last year for the 40k. Still have both. I think I'll try to cancel and do another. By all reports, this should work as well.

Tried last year for my wife who applied for the 25k before the 40k came out. Got nowhere with them with multiple e-mails and calls. I'd say the chances are not good but it doesn't hurt to try.

			I got the card last year when the bonus was 40,000 miles.  The miles and the companion pass code were in the account before I ever got the card.  I received Board Room passes in the mail shortly after.  I used the companion pass for first class flights from Austin to Honolulu this October :-)
I applied for my wife when I saw this yesterday - got the "we'll let you know" screen.  Since she gets the mileage for the flight to Hawaii she'll have a good start on the card!

Yes, you can use the miles on AA or DL or a slew of foreign airlines like BA & AF, but you can't use more than one of their partners on the same award trip.
You can credit EQM & RDM to AS when you fly on some of their partners like AA, DL, or EK, but you can't also get mileage credit on the flown airline. So if you fly on AA, you can credit your miles to AA or to AS, but not both. In order to credit your miles to a different airline than the one you're flying, you specify in the reservation which airline the miles should be credited to (as long as it's one of their partners) and put in your ff # for that airline. The miles should be credited automatically after you fly, but it takes extra time -- on occasion, a very long time or you'll need to ask for the miles to be credited. Make sure to save your boarding passes from the flights in case you need to submit copies as proof of flying. Some fare classes may not receive any mileage credit or may receive more or less than 100% on partner airlines.  On other partner airlines like CX or KE, you can only credit RDM to AS, no EQM.

I haven't applied for my 2nd one yet (got the 40k last year), but there have been quite a few posts that the Bank of America cards are churnable. Of course, YMMV and you still have to have a pretty credit report to get approved

			I was about to apply for the Discover It CB for its rotating categories, but this Mileage version has me interested. Seems smart to use this for everyday spend (non-bonus categories) and maximize 3x for the first year, then sock drawer it for future years (No AF!) And better than than the 2.2% CB on Arrival+...

Does Discover allow product changes? Change the card to one with 5% rotating after the first year

 message 						The fine print talks about redeeming miles for travel credits at 1 cent/mile..but when you close the account or don't use it for 18 months they will credit it back to your account...implying that you would effectively get the cash even if you don't have enough travel to redeem (at some point anyway).

			No bonus.  
Pretend miles--not real airline miles.  
Famously bad customer service.    (don't get me started on my own personal Discover problems ).  Discover's roots in the Sears credit card are still showing.
I get a Discover solicitation just about twice a week.  They go in the shredder.

It's an effective 3% cash back card on all spending, what is there to not like here?

The lack of a signup bonus.  They compare it to the CSP which gives 40,000 points after $4,000 in spending, assuming none of that was dining or travel you spend $4,000 and have 44,000 points (more if you redeem for travel or transfer but that's beside the point).
Redeeming 44,000 points for cash is $440.  In order to earn that same $440 on this Discover card you'd have to spend $14,667.

 message 						on the plus side, however, those of us who just applied for several chase cards and don't think we'd be approved for another like the CSP, for example, might find a discover card attractive.

			Applied. Had to call in. Seems if you have an existing card, you will have to call in to see if you want your old discover card canceled or if you want both.
I said both. At that point they were not willing to extend more credit, but required transferring credit line from existing card (15k) to new one. I left 5k on the old and 10k on the new.
Asked the rep and he said he believed “any miles earned even if from discover deals” count for doubling at the end of the year. This could be potentially lucrative if we find some good discover deals.He said they just launched today and there phones have been off the hook approving the cards and “working out some snags” in the process.

			I had stopped spending my regular discover card that I have had for 15 years. I had been averaging 3k per month and then a year ago discovered miles and churning etc.
They sent me a targeted offer: spend 3k per month for six months and earn $500 bonus to account.
So right now, Im already MS more than normal for that 3k per month in addition to the sign ups for other cards.
If there are no bonus categories then my calculations go like this:
2 * 500 VGC + 2+4.94 fee +0.70 for WM MO = 11.28 per 1000 of MS on this new Discover card. Initial 1.5% back on card =15.17. Minus the MS costs of 11.28 = Profit of 3.89 per 1 MO.
At the end of the year, add in another 15.17 per MO.
Thus if you do 2 MO per day, 5 days a week 48 weeks a year (a few weeks of bora bora and hawaii travel right?) then when all is said and done you have bought 480 MO:
Initial profit accumulated through the year: 1867.2
At the end of 1 year added as a bonus: 7281.6
Total return = 9148.8
That is assuming you can move 2 MO per day and deposit in your credit union/bank without problems etc.
9k is pretty nice.

			Terms regarding reward redeeming options:
Quote:
			
				 Visit Discover.com or call 1-800-347-3085 24 hours a day/7 days a week and choose how to redeem your Miles, including.Credit to your account for travel purchases-starting at 1 mile.
Electronic deposit into an account you designate-starting at 1 mile.
Any way you redeem, 1 Mile is the cash equivalent of 1 penny.
If I understood correctly, you can redeem miles for cash for 1 cent per mile, working just like a cash back card, not necessarily for travel purchases. That being said, it works either like a "travel credit" card (like Capital One Venture) or a plain cash back card (like QuickSilver). So why do they emphasize so much on miles?

 message 						I have the IT card now. If I get the Miles card as well, will I have separate awards for cash back and "miles"? The main question I think needs answering is how the Miles card fits in with Discover Deals? For example, Apple Store is 5% cash back via DD. So if I don't have the regular IT card and go through DD portal to buy an iPad, will I get 5x "miles", or just 5% cash back? Right now when I log on to my Discover account, they separate the cash back earned via CC from the cash back earned via DD. My guess is that they'll do the same if you have the Miles card. We're all hoping that Discover will double the DD earnings at the end of the year (5 "miles" from DD + 1.5 from CC, doubled to 13 "miles"), but I think that's highly unlikely. More realistically, buying an iPad will get 5% cash back and 1.5 "miles" that doubles to 3 "miles" after 12 months.

			"After the first 12 consecutive billing periods that your new account is open, we will double all the Miles you've earned and apply them to your account in the next billing cycle. You will not receive Double Miles if your account is closed or is no longer in the Miles reward program as of the award date."
After all the MS, what if Discover close your acct right before the 12th billing statement?Bait and Switch?

Fidelity Cash Management Debit Card/ATM Forex: Real-World Experience?

			Tried searching for appropriate existing thread, but none I could find. Thanks for patience with this question, if redundant:
I was under the impression that Fidelity Cash Management ATM cards used overseas for ATM cash disbursements charged a 1% FOREX commission, but that the ATM per-use fee was reimbursed.
I talked to a representative today, and he said that the 1% FOREX fee is only for purchases made on the card, but ATM cash withdrawals are not charged the additional 1%.
Does anyone have real-world experience with this issue regarding what fees are/are not charged when using a Fidelity Cash Management ATM card in foreign ATMs for cash withdrawals?
Thanks!

 message 						I routinely get right around the published exchange rate (.00148 vs .00147) for Rwandan francs living here.  Never get charged the receipt fee listed on the machine nor any other fees. Cash USD get a slightly better rate but the fidelity ATM delivers as advertised.  Customer service has been very helpful and quick with US based agents when I've had to call over Skype from India and Rwanda for issues like failing to set a pin before travel and security lockouts despite giving a pretravel notice. No complaints.

Thanks everyone for their feedback! Glad that this card and the CS is well-received.
Any advice from anyone about how to ensure that one's pre-travel notice can best be done in order to avoid a security lockout?Thanks again.

Thanks again.
There is no way to avoid it.  Fraud alert system would still monitor unusual activities.  Even if you already gave travel notice, if your activities fall into some measures the system deem suspicious, it would still block your card. period.
If it happens, just call Fido. Have you gone to their website to poke around?  They have local toll-free phone number for dozens of countries.  Chances are, the places you go, there is a toll-free number for those countries.I called them from Italy using the toll-free specifically for calling from Italy. fyi.

Fidelity Cash Management Debit Card/ATM Forex
 / icon and title 
 message 
			
			Thanks in advance for those of you knowledgeable and kind enough to share your insights:
I am going on a long foreign trip, and am planning on using my Fidelity Cash Management debit card to withdraw cash in each city I visit. This is a new one for me, as I used to bring foreign cash or use travelers checks along with my credit card.
My question for those in the know: (1) Is there a fixed daily withdrawal limit? (2) Is this limit in USA dollars equivalent or some other measure, and (2) Does anyone have experience in getting the limit raised for them?
Many thanks!

 message 						Thanks for your reply. For the benefit of anyone else who has an interest, I did call Fidelity when their "A" Team was in the office, and had my card activated for this purpose. They told me I had a $1k per day withdrawal limit, and that there could be a total of 8 transactions per day.

			Yes, there is a daily limit and is in  US$.  The limit is set by the bank your account is assigned to as you know Fidelity itself has no bank.  Mine is assigned to Fifththird, with a paltry $500 daily limit.  It is enough for our need as we mostly use credit cards whenever possible.  The limit could be raised I am told.
I cannot believe in these days and age, one would still use Traveler's Check.  We quit bring TC since late 1990's when ATMs starting showing up around the world.  In countries where there were no ATM yet, such as Spain, we created a credit balance with our Visa credit card, then just did a cash advance at local bank with said card.  No fee, just presented the passport.
ATM gives you the BEST possible Inter-bank average rate that is often 5% better than the retail rate you would get when you cash your TC to exchange for local currency, sometimes with a fee.  
Here is a real story to ease your mind - we came back from a month long trip with the first half being in China, second half being in France with HKG in between  - when boarding our Air China flight IAH-PEK, there was K9 unit on  the walkway down to the jet bridge.  After the lovely dog sniffed around, we thought it was done.  Nope.  There were 7 or 8 more officers further down the walkway.  One asked me how much cash I brought, I said may be $100 or so.  He then asked how much CNY I had.  I said 0 but I brought 2 ATM cards.  Aint there ATMs in China just like here?  The officer next to him could not hold back his broad smile...  Then the original officer asked my husband who was walking behind me...  Without looking back I told him my husband probably had less than $20 on him.   The other officer now could not hold it any more but laughed out...  Similar thing happened on a land crossing to Canada a few years ago...
In China I used the FIDO ATM card 5 times as it was largely still a Cash society.  Transactions also did not show up in real time like in Europe.  Withdrawal made on weekend showed up later than subsequent withdrawal made on Monday... Just little quirky things.  Other than that, it is no different from the previous dozs of trips to elsewhere in the world...  Europe, South Pacific, Asia...  anywhere there is a Visa logo ATM, you can use your FIDO ATM card.
Seriously, when you travel, all you need to make sure is to have your passport, credit cards and ATM cards.  I emphasize the s. Airports, Train and Subway stations in many cities always have ATMs.  Even in St. Petersburg and Moscow, you can find ATM in subway stations.  You really dont need to bring foreign cash except small amount of some very common ones or for places you tend to go very often, like Euro, that you would keep the left-overs from previous trip for future trip.One of the big advantage of a no fee ATM card is, you can make small withdrawals as you go - this is important when your trip involves 9 currencies... when we had a 46 days trip in a "Circle Pacific" type trip in 2009, there were 9 currencies to deal with.  Having the Fido / Schwab ATM cards truly made things simpler.

			There is a 1% foreign transaction fee per the check card agreement. (https://www.fidelity.com/bin-public/...0Agreement.pdf)
However it does not specify if it's for a swipe purchase or ATM withdrawal.
Anyone can clarify?
Thanks
Edit:I just chat with Fido online, agent told me 1% fee applies to both transaction and ATM withdrawal, and is charged by VISA.  Also he said the new accounts group can decide to do a hard credit check, it's up to them, and no way to know for sure.

I've talked to several people in the Premium Account group, and have gotten consistent information that ATM withdrawals are not subject to the transaction fees. However, that is based upon having a Cash Management account.

The PDF says one thing, but it's not the reality.
No FTF is charged on ATM withdrawals.
Using a debit card is crazy to begin with, so the 1% on that is irrelevant.

You are being misinformed.  There is no 1% transaction fee on ATM withdrawal, but there is a 1% Visa NETWORK FEE, and is not charged by Fido, but the bank which ATM you use if the bank decides to recoup this from Visa.
My card is from the Cash Management Account which I turned off the linkage to the brokerage account that can have its own ATM card - regardless which account your ATM card is from, it does not matter - they function the SAME and are subject to the same terms.
Truth be told, the 1% is truly up to the bank whether it is charged or not.
Of the 5 or 6 years we use FIDO's card, we were charge 1% only ONCE, at a BNP branch in Aix-en-Provence. I took 100 euro, and there is a 1 euro separately listed, as "Purchase".  That was the 1%.  BNP in Paris does not charge that fee btw.
All other times, from all over the world, including BNPs in various places, there is never a 1% separate line.  The exchange rates do have small variances to the XC site's historical rates of intra-day Avg bank rates, but the variances were within 0.03% or below, so I conclude they are truly due to rate fluctuation during the day, and not anything being padded.
One thing I do notice is, you would get a slightly worse rate if your withdrawals were made preceding a US Bank closing days, like weekend or holidays and the transactions would not post until next business day after the bank closure.  Again, unless you are taking a large sum out, for the couple hundred bucks withdrawals, I would not get all worked up by that.If you are bothered by the 1% charge potential, get the Schwab's Investor Checking account and its ATM card.  Schwab has its own bank and the daily limit is a high $2K that could be raised temporary if you need that.  No fee whatsoever, and they reimburse ATM fee on a monthly basis, versus Fido reimburses it immediately after each occurrence.

			To separate the discussion of contactless payments from the main EMV thread, I've create a thread of its own to discuss contactless cards.

I used one today at a McDonald's and it worked just fine with my Discover ZIP card. For me, it's Taco Bell I have an issue with. They have them installed, but they're behind anti-robbery plexi-glass so it makes no sense.

 message 						I used my ISIS Serve at Walgreens the other day.  I have seen a few places that should have the potential to do it, but weren't hooked up for it or weren't working.  Honestly, it doesn't save me any time, so I probably will just do it the normal way.  It is cool tech though.

Anti-robbery plexiglas at Taco Bell? Granted, the one near my school had an armed robbery earlier this year, but still. I wouldn't want to live in a neighbourhood where that was considered okay or necessary.
Anyway, fill out a complaint on the Mastercard Paypass locator that contactless is not easily accessible.

I used to have an Amex that had RFID contactless that I converted to EMV early on that would have been nice for testing.I also wonder if I can get an Android phone on the used market that Softcard supports, turn on prepaid T-Mobile service long enough to activate the app and simply use it with WiFi. Mainly interested in seeing if cardpeek spits out a more EMV compliant result or whether Softcard's implementation is magstripe based (and thus might have problems outside the US) like Google Wallet's.

Coming across places with cashiers behind plexi-glass is normal here in LA, especially in establishments that were built during the high gang violence years of the 1990s. Not all Taco Bells have them, just the Taco Bells built/renovated during the 1990s. Heck, I think even all the BofA here in LA has them since the NoHo shootout.
Life in LA is quite different from Missoula. Coming across banks, post offices and fast food places with cashiers behind plexiglass are just considered normal.

I already did 3 years ago, still keeps them behind the plexiglass.

Worth complaining again, and I'm definitely not comparing to Missoula. I'm comparing to London, Berlin, Bucharest, Calgary, Amsterdam, etc... mostly London since that's the city I've spent by far the most time in in my life.

I think we've established by now from the past discussions that:
A. The networks really don't enforce their rules and regulations and,
B. This is Murica we're talking about here.

Why Apple Pay could succeed where others have had underwhelming results
Quote:

But lucky for Apple, a terminal upgrade will be necessary soon in the US. In late 2015, American merchants will have to buy new terminals that support EMV cards, which are more secure (although definitely not hack-proof) than the magnetic stripe cards that the US currently still uses. By October of next year, merchants who don't upgrade their terminals will be made to bear the responsibility for fraud if they are not equipped with EMV card readers. Merchants are deploying new POS terminals in order to comply with the requirement to have EMV capability in place by October 2015, and nearly all new terminals have the contactless capability needed to accept mobile payments, senior analyst Thad Peterson of the independent research firm Aite Group told Ars via e-mail. So, we will very quickly have a critical mass of devices and a critical mass of terminals that are capable of making and accepting mobile payments. (Peterson added, The time has come.)
Also, next year's transition to EMV, which is already a widely-supported standard in Europe, Canada, and many other countries, might very well push American consumers to use their phones to pay in increasing numbers, whether that phone is a iPhone 6 or a Samsung Galaxy Note 4. This is because many credit cards based on the new standard will require that the embedded chip be present in the terminal as it reads the necessary information, meaning credit card transactions could take a second or two longer than a quick swipe of a magnetic stripe card. That extra second or two added onto a transaction might be enough to get consumers to feel like using a phone is faster.

			I've been using Google Wallet for about a year now at Walgreens. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  When it works, it's cool and cashiers are always impressed and ask me questions.
When it doesn't work, I look like an idiot. I sit there tapping my phone and nothing happens, or it vibrates a little and still nothing happens. And the cashier scowls and says "that never works" and I'm like "it works sometimes" and then I have to pull out my old fashioned card and swipe it while people behind me look at me with much disapproval for holding things up.
Then there's the time when I pull out my phone and it won't work because I don't have a network signal for some reason. I put in my PIN and the little circle thing just keeps spinning, all the while everyone is looking at you like an idiot. So instead I try to pre-enter my PIN before I get to the check out -- which is kind of stupid when you think about it.  
Walgreens is the only place I've used it because it's the only place I've gotten it to work. I've seen the Paywave thing at other places but I've tried and never got it to work, along with the "looking like an idiot" problem. So I stopped even trying now.      
It's really a big hassle. Hopefully Apple pulls it off better. If they do, they deserve to walk all over Google's implementation. Because frankly it sucks. But I have my doubts because I think it's a terminal/merchant/provider issue and instead of just me looking like an idiot, soon there's going to be a plethora of Apple users  holding up lines everywhere tapping their phones trying to pay and holding everyone up when it doesn't work.

Yup, exactly, it is a merchant issue. Newer terminals with built-in contactless greatly reduce what can go wrong, though.

When it doesn't work, I look like an idiot. I sit there tapping my phone and nothing happens, or it vibrates a little and still nothing happens. And the cashier scowls and says "that never works" and I'm like "it works sometimes" and then I have to pull out my old fashioned card and swipe it while people behind me look at me with much disapproval for holding things up.
Then there's the time when I pull out my phone and it won't work because I don't have a network signal for some reason. I put in my PIN and the little circle thing just keeps spinning, all the while everyone is looking at you like an idiot. So instead I try to pre-enter my PIN before I get to the check out -- which is kind of stupid when you think about it.  
Walgreens is the only place I've used it because it's the only place I've gotten it to work. I've seen the Paywave thing at other places but I've tried and never got it to work, along with the "looking like an idiot" problem. So I stopped even trying now.      
It's really a big hassle. Hopefully Apple pulls it off better. If they do, they deserve to walk all over Google's implementation. Because frankly it sucks. But I have my doubts because I think it's a terminal/merchant/provider issue and instead of just me looking like an idiot, soon there's going to be a plethora of Apple users  holding up lines everywhere tapping their phones trying to pay and holding everyone up when it doesn't work.  
Well I understand that feeling, as I've had one issue with a Walgreens, but that was right before they had contactless completely up and this CVS with older terminals has not been working too well either lately. Are you using the same register each time and its working on and off, or different ones, as one may be broken. My Mcdonalds has always worked but one of the registers is a bit buggy but still works, but I haven't tested contactless payments at other Mcdonald's. The local Whole Foods just got brand new Verifone MX915 terminals and they work perfectly. Home Depot worked perfectly, but they have another one with contactless built into the screen, so it works better. Most places I've tried just work, but a few local places had no idea how to run it so it didn't work, but that is different from broken equipment.

This thread is a continuation of the discussion posted here from 12.08.2012 - 5.13.2014:
Barclays Arrival/Arrival Cards (1.1%/2.2% travel credits)
The $89 annual fee is waived for the 1st year, so this means that youre getting at least $400 in statement credits after spending $3,000 within 3 months.
Barclays says that you earn miles but youre actually earning cash back with the card since you cant transfer your Barclays miles to airlines.  But you can redeem them for statement credits at 0.5 cents per mile (poor value) or 1.1 cent per mile if you redeem for travel.
You get 10% of your miles back if you redeem for travel, so 40,000 miles gets you $400 towards travel and 4,000 miles back (10% of your miles back).  You can then redeem these 4,000 miles which you got back for $40 towards travel.  And so on
You earn 2X miles on all purchases, so youre effectively getting 2% cash back for each purchase.  But since you get 10% of your miles back when you redeem for travel, this is effectively a 2.2% cash back card when miles are redeemed for travel.
This makes the Barclaycard Arrival PlusTM World Elite MasterCard® (with 2.2% cash back for travel) better than the Capital One Venture card which offers only 2 miles per $1 or 2% cash back and the best cash back card for travel.
If you receive a call from 302-255-8000 after applying for this or any other Barclay's card, it is a legit number! You can also call them back directly at 866-951-1437.

Regarding official company representatives
Note that there is an official procedure for company representatives to register themselves with the FlyerTalk Community Director and verify their credentials.  When that process is completed, the username will turn green in posts, rather than the standard blue.Anyone who does not appear in green has not followed this procedure.  Those posts should be considered the same as any other user's posts.  It is important to remember that the moderation team does not generally monitor the veracity of any posts; it is up to you to judge a poster's content and history yourself.

			Barclaycard Arrival is changing, the no fee version will remain the same however the annual fee version will be known as Barclaycard Arrival + MasterCard. Some big changes includes additional categories like theme parks, museums, tourist attractions, taxis, limos, buses, ferries and more for redemptions. The 90 day limit will extend to 120. The card will have a brand new design in blue featuring EMV chip. All existing fee accounts will be issued new plastics as of May 28th featuring chip and new card design. All existing no fee accounts will be issued a new plastic with chip upon card expiration or card replacement request made on or after 5/28. You can apply for the new card as of 5/14-5/16, the date may change.

This is great! Source? I just was approved yesterday, I wonder if my card will come like this or it'll just send a new one then.

It's not clear whether you will be part of the new acquisitions or existing card campaign. You may get the new card since so close to launch but if not, then after 5/28 you will be reissued a new plastic. Source? Nothing I can link to.

Can you tell us if this is a true Chip and PIN card?  (Default/Priority Chip and PIN, not just fallback if Chip and Signature fails.)
Many of us are hoping for a card from a major issuer that defaults to Chip and PIN in the USA.  It seems none do that yet. (Maybe Chase soon?)

			I'm also seeing that the amount of time I have left to redeem older purchases on this card has increased. 
My 3.19 purchase now shows a 120 day redemption time instead of 90 days. I know this change was for the new purchases, but I didn't think our old purchases would be elevated to the new redemption schedule!

			Some additional notes...the card is depicted as World Elite but we were told only select accounts would be upgraded based on spend, so this is strange they are offering it for applications. The conversions were suppose to take place on 5/28, letters went out on Monday and an email will be sent on 5/20 to notify customers of the upcoming changes. So it is also strange they updated the online so soon before anyone got notice. This will just burden support channels with card replacement requests for people wanting the chip now and calls asking about the changes. So obviously Barclays is lousy with communication and the various teams don't communicate with each other because this rollout is happening very early and completely out or the specified and trained order. Another botched roll out just like Hawaiian Airlines

It's Chip & Signature with PIN, just like Hawaiian Airlines.

This is awesome.  Online my card appears as the Plus version now, and after I read your synopsis, I checked my reward redemption options and I can now indeed redeem for taxi, Uber, and tourist attractions (Empire State Building to be specific), none of which were redeemable yesterday.

 message 						Really excited about the new card.  Hate that I'll actually be out of the country for the 5/28 issuing, but looking forward to picking it up when I get back.  My favorite card just got even better!

 Oh now they want to add theme parks??  (After I spent $600 at Disney earlier this year. LOL).  It's still cool though and nice changes.
Just logged into my Barclay acct and they have already changed the Arrival image on my acct page.  It's pretty.  Hehe.

			While awesome, I would of appreciated a heads up from the Barclays team, just for the sake of communication. Per usual, I get more info on FT than the actual institution 
Still, very excited for the new features. Taxi/uber/limo and tourist attractions will be a big plus. Really hope I can redeem for my commuter train/transit costs -- that would be huge. Like if your employer reimburses transit already, then double reimbursement?

Datapoints:
There is a $90 AF and one cannot earn the 90K in one year unless one does $25K spending.
Best way to add to initial purchase bonus of 20K is to add AUs (and quite a few of them, too!).

			I think Virgin Atlantic miles are underrated.
It's borderline impossible to get a full family on award miles from LAX to Lon (or even LAS to MAN).  They regularly have 2 upper class, 5 economy, and 5 economy plus seats open for flights.  Economy plus while a slight rip off is always wide open, so if you need to score 4-6 seats, it's one of the few options out there. BA is the only other airline to have so many seats open out of LAX, and the fees are worse on BA.

 message 						82.5k miles for $15k spend is pretty good.  Does anyone know if we'll need to pay the annual fee again on the anniversary to get the anniversary miles?  (assuming you hit the spend for those)

 message 						I got the same email and am seriously thinking about applying. I keep receiving their mailer about the 65000 mile offer (which I ignore) so this is definitely a better offer. Need to dig deeper into what other airlines I can redeem those miles though.

http://www.virgin-atlantic.com/us/en.../airlines.html There you have all partners.I think it's a good offer, and will probably apply soon. Hit the minimum spend with an authorized user and you end up with 87k miles.

			I have no BOA relationship, but this might push me towards it. By my calculations, I'd get:
20K signup
50K spend bonus
18K from spend
5K from AU93K miles after 6 months, with the ability to earn another 12K (7500 + 4500 from spend) with an additional $3K spend, or another 34.5K (15K + 19.5K from spend) with an additional $13K spend, for a total after 12 months of 128K miles on $25K spend (5x).

			This seems like a great deal, although it’s really more of a 75K offer, I wouldn’t count the 15K miles you get at your anniversary. I am not too worried about the minimum spend since it can be spread out over 6 months. Is it easy to transfer the points to Virgin America and do they transfer 1:1? I’ve been wanting to get more VA points couldn’t think of any efficient way.

			Got this card today along with the BofA Alaskan Airlines card. Had to recon for the Virgin card, but I got approved with a 5k limit.

100,000 points after spending $5,000 in first three months.  Requires personal application at a branch in one of six states: NY, DE, GA, TN, NV & CA.  Branch might require an account, such as a no fee $500 savings account.  Proof of income is required.  Bank is looking for high worth individuals.  Offer expires 30 December 2015.  Fee free the first year, then $400 annually.Register your card for online access (Cnb.com/creditcardonline) and register separately for the award page (www.cnbrewards.com).  Click "my info" to see details on points awarded.Best* redemption found to date is $1,000 prepaid visa for 105K pts.  Link to catalog
*(other that spending for flights etc. & getting 1.2 cents each in value)
Significant benefits:    $250 per calendar year airline incidental credit - works on AU card as well    $100 Global Entry fee credit     Priority Pass lounge membership for up to 2 people.    12 GoGo inflight passes - create an account at myvisainfinite.com/cnb.

    $100 off when you book a qualifying airline itinerary via visa discount air portal
Airline fees are reimbursed up to $250 per calendar year.  Fees must be from domestic carriers.  There is no need to declare a carrier, and fees can be reimbursed from multiple carriers.  Partial Ts and Cs:
Qualifying Airline Purchases are defined as incidental airline fee transactions made at eligible US-Domestic Airline Carriers (each an "Eligible Airline") on domestic itineraries and include: seat upgrade charges, ticket change/cancellation fees, checked baggage fees, in-flight entertainment, onboard food and beverage charges, airport lounge membership fees and day passes, onboard wireless charges (excluding Gogo Wireless)What worksAA: Award Fees/Taxes, Award Redeposit Fees ($150)

WN: GCTo Be Confirmed
UA: Award Redeposit Fees ($200)
There have been numerous reports of no airline-credit reimbursements for the 2016 calendar year. YMMV, but proceed with caution.

 message 						The card sounds like it's chip and signature with a backup PIN (like Barclay's) according to https://www.cnb.com/lending/cards/chipcards-faq.asp. That would really suck if kiosk transactions outside the US didn't earn points though.

 message 						My understanding is that Puerto Rico banks only accept credit card applications from Puerto Rico.  I don't know if USA banks accept credit card applications from Puerto Rico, but given the former, I would not classify PR as USA when talking about credit cards...

			Many USA based banks accept applications from PR (Chase, Citi, Amex, Discover, BoA/Fidelity, many CUs), and those that don't will allow you to keep your accounts open (like my Cap1 Quicksilver and my Barclays AA Aviator). 
PR banks "don't" accept applications from non PR residents, but they will allow you to keep an account open if you move off island.  I use "don't", because I know of a handful posters on this board that applied BPPR AAdvantage cards for the bonus, and were able to get them.Furthermore PR banks are FDIC members and pull US credit reports (generally TU, but a few EQ/EX pullers exist).

Please don't delete this Wiki. Some of us still earn Delta miles with this card or may want information about past or grandfathered terms and conditions.
You are not allowed to spread panic about miles not posting until after the 10th of each month.
In most cases, miles post in the evening on the 5th of each month if it's a business day, or else the evening of the next business day.  "Miles post for purchases made between (inclusive) 5th day of prior month to 4th day of current month."
Current offer is apparently in-branch only, through May 9, 2016:
INTRODUCING YOUR NEW EVERYDAY GETAWAY CARD: THE SKYMILES® DEBIT CARD.
Ready for a one-of-a-kind debit card that actually rewards you? Here's one that deposits miles directly into your SkyMiles account. You can earn up to 25,000 bonus miles with the SkyMiles World Debit Card from SunTrust. What's more, when you use your Card for everyday purchases, the miles add up quickly  and they'll never expire.
Here's how it works:	Present this email at your nearest branch, or call 1-800-650-7277 and mention this offer.	Get 5,000 bonus miles when you open or upgrade to a new qualifying SunTrust Signature Advantage Checking account with a Delta SkyMiles Debit Card and make your first qualifying purchase. If you already have a Signature Advantage Checking account, ask to upgrade your debit card to a Delta SkyMiles Debit Card.	Get an additional 20,000 promotional bonus miles when you make 20 qualifying purchases within the first 90 days of account opening.Continue to earn miles just for using your Card:	Earn 1 mile for every dollar spent on everyday purchases like groceries, gas and restaurant purchases.1 (up to 4,000 per Card monthly)	Earn 2 miles per dollar on all direct Delta purchases including flights, Delta Sky Club® passes, in-flight purchases of food and beverages and more.1	Apply your miles toward upgrades and Award Travel to more than 1,000 destinations worldwide2 on Delta and its partner airlines.	$75 Annual Fee (reduced fee may apply, ask for details).1Hurry  this incredible 25,000 bonus mile offer is only available until May 9, 2016.
VISIT YOUR LOCAL BRANCH
There's also some general information at this link.
History of Recent Past Offers:

			Not as lucrative as past offers, it does offer those unable to get a premium travel credit card a chance to play the game. 
The promo runs until June 30th:15K DL miles on opening an account with $100 minimum balance15K more DL miles when establishing a real direct deposit
The check card costs $75 and there are monthly fees if you don't maintain a hefty balance.
Suntrust Bank has been extremely good to us in the past but they have tightened considerably at least in my Hilton Head Island branch. This time they will only accept walk in applicants.
Maybe somebody else can find a branch willing to take mail in applicants?
I have no indication if multiple authorized users can get separate cards.

Suntrust Delta World Check CardSame in my area, Florida.  Also, Tennessee. Walk-ins only. I notice other banks (non-SunTrust) are also extending more generous offers to walk-ins.  They'd "like to get to know you" [Spanky & Our Grang,  1968 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80Y3l0_1US4 ]

			Good thing I'm headed to Florida so that I can walk in.  Just hope that I don't find a long line around the block.

			Anyone know if a monthly electronic deposit from an outside Savings Account (e.g. American Express Online Savings Account) would qualify as a direct deposit?  Their wording is a little vague (italics mine):
"A qualifying Direct Deposit is a direct deposit of your salary, pension, Social Security or other regular monthly income of $100 or more per deposit electronically deposited to your account during statement cycle by your employer or an outside agency. Transfers from one account to another or deposits made at a banking location or ATM do not qualify as a Direct Deposit. "

No, must be direct deposit from payroll.

Sorry, my signature line had nothing to do with the context of my post.
You do not need to visit a SunTrust branch to sign up for their check card.

Not sure on the business side.  Personal side gets free checks with the right checking account, free check card, free suntrust atm use, limited amount of waivers for non-atm use.  All with the right checking account.

 message 						I know this offer was on deck before and lucrative. Could someone explain what the old offer was and what made it lucrative? Please clearly label you post. I just want to understand what to look for in the new offer. Multiple accounts? Multiple authorized user? etc.

Here is the Delta Landing page.  According to the Delta sign up page (here), you should be able to sign up online, by calling or by going into a branch.  But, when you click the sign up online section, it does not provide the "open now" link that Delta is referencing.
The checking account bonus and enrollment bonus are limited time offers from 5/1/2012-6/30/2012 and are only available once per customer.I am assuming that means that you cannot add authorized users.

 message 						Keep in mind that this offer cannot take advantage of the low fees for the Everyday Checking account, SunTrust's basic checking account, and instead requires Balanced Banking or above, checking products that impose at least a $12 monthly fee for checking and other SunTrust accounts that, in total, fall below $3000 (not a daily average--and other products impose higher fees and minimum balance requirements). Not bad if you intend to maintain a decent balance with SunTrust or already have some other accounts there, but certainly a factor to throw in when calculating whether $75 plus possible monthly fees are worth 30K Delta miles to you.

			Just verified via SunTrust's online chat feature that this offer can be accessed without going into a physical branch. "Jenny" was all revved to get me set up. (Don't have the time right now but will do it later.)
Not sure if you can do it all online without a chat helper though.update: just completed setting up the account with this offer via the chat. Thanks again Rick.

Where did you see this? The only business offer I see is for a 5,000 mile bonus after first use with the card that will cost a whopping $125 annual fee. Sweet deal! Not.

 Beginning Async AdSlot 13 for Ad unit ### size: [[300,250]] 
 Adslot's refresh function: googletag.pubads().refresh([gptadslots[13]]]) 
 End AdSlot 13			Hello,    One of my biggest spending categories is eating out and groceries. They total to about $400 a month. I was thinking about going for the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card since it offers 2x points for this category. That alone should cover the $95 annual fee. I right now have the Chase Freedom Card which offers 1% back and 5% back during certain quarters with no annual fee. Also since this year I will be travelling quite a bit I can use the 50k points they give for spending $4k in the first 3 months for the flight tickets. Are there any better credit cards out there for dining and grocery categories? Interest rates don't make a difference since I pay off my credit card in full every single month.

Is Capital One Spark available for personal use or only for businesses?

			Well, CSP will give you 2X on dining but not groceries.  If you have a use for MR points, I'd recommend either PRG (2x on dining and groceries) or EDP (4.5X on groceries, 1.5X on dining/everything else).  You need to make 30 purchases a month in order to get those returns on the EDP.If you want to go cash back you should do AMEX BCP--6% on groceries up to 6k in purchases a year and then Chase AARP or the new Costco Visa for 3% back at restaurants.

I don't have a business.  I just lied that I did LOL.  I listed the business name, as my name.  They didnt even question it.  I got Tons of Business Cards this way, including Chase Ink, And United Explorer Business.  Just make up some BS, and list yourself as a sole proprietor.  They don't care.

Cappy 1 isn't Known for doing FR's.  Had Them for Years.  Anyway, if they ever did, I'll move on to another victim.  The only company I don't get along with is Amex..  I don't do any business with Amex. anyway, now.

Note that the PRG only gives category bonuses for US restaurants, grocery store, and gas stations. You will not get such a bonus internationally.
Also consider the Citi Premier or Prestige cards, which earn 2X TYP on restaurant spend. They also have other categories and benefits that might be of interest to you.

 message 						$400 in restaurant spending per month doesn't justify the $95 annual fee.  You're getting an incremental 1% in rewards over the Freedom, so that's $48/year.  And if you factor in that Freedom gets 5% for 1 quarter per year, you're actually at breakeven (5%*400*3 + 1%*400*9 = 2%*4800), so paying the annual fee gets you nothing other than the fringe benefits.  I imagine nothing will beat a no annual fee 2% card for you (Citi Double Cash, FIA (soon to be US Bank) Fidelity).  That said, I'm all for grabbing sign up bonuses, so if you're going to get the CSP for a year then ditch it, go for it   But your spending doesn't justify keeping it on an ongoing basis.

I agree with this, and I personally believe UR points have more valuable transfer partners than Citi and Amex's rewards programs, but that also depends on your travel goals. If MR is valuable to you, I'd take the EDP hands down.
But I do think the CSP is worth keeping open even if your 2x bonus spend isn't entirely justifying the AF. The fringe benefits mentioned are very good, especially the ones including trip/luggage/auto insurance, but by sacrificing the CSP you're also sacrificing the ability to transfer your points to airline and hotels, which is usually where the biggest value can be gained - and one good transfer vs purchasing with points can be worth the AF several times over.

 message 						Alot of people get business cards with no legit business at all.
That's not a problem and no one will FR a business card, well not that i know off.
The problem arises when you default on business cards, then it will be considered fraud as you have no legit business.

			With  A business card you do not have the same credit card rights .
 I had an FR are with American Express that was the reason I brought it up.
 I also have several, Chase and Citi  Business card, but them I have been churning for a good 40 years. Capital use to be the care of choice for low credit score clients, today maybe a different story, 
 In today's world it's pretty hard to open up a business checking account, but a sole proprietor credit card is not that hard to get,  all you need is a Social Security number.In the old days we could get a SS Number, from the grave yard, but that paper game is over..

			I recently made use of some balance transfer promos. One card (Barclays) had an annual fee and when I checked with customer service was told that the BT terms would remain the same even if I closed my card. My credit score seems to have dipped from 750ish to 600 and I'm wondering if the closed card had a larger effect than the others.

Probably. I mean, I think your utilization on that card is literally infinite percent, since you have no credit allocated to the account and have a balance. I could be wrong, though.

In particular see post 7 for a summary of the range of possible ways that issuers report in this circumstance. The credit limit is not always shown as zero.

What is it?
Dynamic Currency Conversion (DCC) is a "service" some merchants and ATM operators offer that will charge a cardholder in the native currency of the card rather than the local currency.  A more complete definition and examples are available via this Wikipedia article on DCC.  While sold as a convenience to cardholders traveling outside of their home country, it is a pure profit play by the merchants. You may end up paying a fee of up to 8% over the purchase price for accepting DCC.  Always decline DCC and asked to be billed in the local currency!
Where will I see it?
You can be hit with DCC anywhere there is a difference between your debit or credit card's denominated currency and the currency of the location where you're trying to use the card.  The most common example will be at a merchant overseas, but now some ATMs are offering the service too.  While many US cardholders complain about getting tricked into accepting DCC overseas, some merchants in the US have started to use DCC as well.
What is the issue?
Unless you're the merchant or ATM operator, there isn't much benefit to using DCC.  Some customers say they prefer knowing exactly how much they'll be charged in their home currency or may not know the exchange rate of the place where they are visiting.  For example, if you are in Prague for two days and you don't know how much the Czech Koruna is worth relative to the US Dollar, you might feel more comfortable knowing that you're buying an item for $205.00 versus 4000 CZK.  However, the real exchange rate as of January 18, 2014 would place 4000 CZK at $197.18.  You just paid an extra $7.82 for the "convenience" of knowing how much you'd be charged!
DCC often charges about a 4% premium over the true exchange rate. The problems don't stop there since many US banks still charge a 3% foreign transaction fee (FTF) for purchases made outside of the US.  Not only would you get hit with the $205.00 charge, you could also find yourself facing a total charge of $211.15 if your card has a 3% FTF.
This is a pure money grab from the merchants, and it's billed as an easy way to squeeze additional revenue out of the transaction.  Numerous [1, 2] articles have talked about DCC duping many consumers.  Discover even has a warning about being tricked into DCC when using a card abroad.
For example, this FlyerTalk member reported that Avis charged his Saudi credit card in Saudi riyals instead of USD for a car rental in Florida without his consent.  This has also been a trend for hotels, particularly large chains as indicated here and here.
DCC is simply not worth it for the consumer.  Unless you like paying a convenience fee of up to 5% of the total transaction just to know how much you will be billed, you should always decline DCC and ask to be billed in local currency when handing over your card.
Furthermore, it is in your interest to obtain a card that has a 0% FTF.  FlyerTalk member kebosabi maintains a fairly comprehensive spreadsheet of EMV-enabled cards ideal for overseas travel, many of which offer a low or 0% FTF as a feature.  There is also a wiki  at FlyerGuide of various FTF of debit and credit cards.
What can I do to avoid DCC?
American Express currently does not support DCC on its network, so you are safe from DCC if using an American Express card.  However, Visa and MasterCard card networks can support DCC, so be vigilant when purchasing abroad with a Visa or MasterCard branded card.  There have been reports of being charged DCC with a Discover card in China [citation needed], but primarily the issue is happening with Visa and MasterCard cards.
Before handing your card to the merchant, always specify clearly that you want to be charged in the local currency and that you do not want DCC.  For some transactions, you retain control of your card as you dip it into a chip reader and can view on a screen to select which currency you want to use for the transaction.  Always select the local currencyto get the best exchange rate.  Do not select the card's native currency!
Similarly, for ATM withdrawals, make sure you decline any kind of conversions.  Some good examples of what to look for when using an ATM overseas are here and here.  You're probably coming off of a long flight and fatigued, but educating yourself beforehand can save you from getting ripped off.  The user interfaces on almost all of these ATMs are set up to encourage you to take the bait, and you have to be extremely vigilant not to fall for it.
If you are doing a PIN-based transaction, you should have the opportunity to review the total amount and denomination of the transaction before entering your PIN.  If you are doing a signature transaction and the merchant has processed your transaction with DCC, cross out the amount and write "DCC refused" on the receipt.  Do not sign the receipt, and demand that the merchant reverse the transaction and run it in the local currency.  If no verification is required due to a small purchase amount, ask the merchant to reverse the charge and repeat the transaction using local currency.  If all else fails, file a dispute with your card issuer when you return home.  Even if it's immaterial, the banks will get the message like they did with EMV.
Some merchants will claim that their systems have to bill you in your native currency.  This is a complete lie.  But just like a mag stripe only card, this is battle where you have to be prepared.  Don't settle for merchants claiming that "it has to be done this way" or "pay cash if you don't want this".  Be prepared to walk away, and, if you must complete the transaction, write "DCC refused & merchant didn't give a choice" on the receipt and cross out the amount.  Let the merchant know that you will be filing a dispute with your bank.
Disabling DCC
Disabling DCC on ANZ terminals in Australia
ANZ markets DCC as Customer Preferred Currency (CPC). Terminal operators can contact ANZ Merchant Services at 1800 039 025 to have this feature disabled. Currently, your Visa or MasterCard will be subjected to DCC if denominated in: CAD, CHF, DKK, EUR, GBP, HKD, JPY, MYR, NOK, NZD, SEK, SGD, THB, USD, or ZAR. All DCC transactions on ANZ will cause a 2.5% markup. Steps to avoid DCC:
Insert, swipe, or tap your payment card
Have the cashier select credit (CR)
The terminal will display CREDIT ACCOUNT
If applicable, enter your PIN
The terminal will display PROCESSING \ PLEASE WAIT
The terminal will display EXCH <exchange rate> \ <currency> <amount> \ ACCEPT RATE? \ ENTER=YES CLR=NO
Instruct the cashier to press the yellow CLEAR (CLR) button (If entering a PIN, you can retain the terminal to perform this step yourself. If entering a signature, you can ask for the terminal to control this process, not indicating that it's a chip-and-signature card.)
The transaction should now process without DCC
If you see a signature slip with DCC verbiage and a checkbox indicating a currency selection, kindly ask the merchant to void the transaction. If it's a PIN-based transaction, you have an additional opportunity to cancel the transaction because it will ask for your PIN a second time. For instance, if you see "EUR 17.29 KEY PIN" refuse to enter your PIN and start again.
Disabling DCC in China
There are many reports of forced DCC in China, and there is a great thread [closed to new posts] on DCC in China on the the China Destinations forum.
Disabling DCC on Bankcomm terminals in Beijing http://www.hongkongcard.com/forum/fo...p?id=12272&p=2 #19
jair101's DCC instructions of March 2011 http://www.etveg.com/misc/DCC_China.pdf
Disabling DCC in Eurozone and UK
DCC offered in tourist traps (Harrods Knightsbridge/Galleries Lafayette Montparnesse/El Cortes Ingles Grand Via Madrid)Unlike the rest of the world, Visa Europe does not require merchants to collect a ticked box on the slip (presumably because merchants there don't keep signed slips under Chip-and-PIN)El Cortes Ingles collects a signature electronically and the DCC selection is made on the signature pad - the choice is respected.
Harrods and GL rely on cashier input in the POS for the currency choice - the cashier may forget to ask. The POS do not offer voiding (only refunds), but since you're given a slip to sign the best thing to do is to deface it before signing and submit chargeback request to issuer bank on return home.
There may be smaller merchants who also collect DCC but I seemed to have pre-empted most of them by saying "charge Euros (Pounds) please"
In Spain all merchants by law are required to provide you with a complaint form called an hoja de reclamaciones if requested. The form has two carbon copies. The customer retains one copy as a record of the complaint. The merchant maintains another copy, and the third is sent to the local consumer protection bureau. Merchants are also required to post a sign conspicuously informing the customer of the right to complain (usually in Spanish and English). Do not accept the lie that they don't have any forms. This is illegal, and you are able to call the police if the merchant refuses to provide you with this official form. It's interesting to see merchants start to squirm when you know the rules, and most merchants will start to be accommodating after you mention it. (Please still fill out the form even if the merchant cooperates after mentioning it because these are likely the merchants who won't otherwise change their behavior.)
Disabling DCC in Hong Kong and Macau
Hong Kong and Macau can get as non-compliant as China, possibly because many acquirers have cross-border operations and know they can get away with non-compliant firmware and procedures.
In practice, if you are given a DCC slip, and the cashier has not taken a choice before giving you your copy, the slip will be processed in your home currency - be prepared to dispute.

Disabling DCC in Japan and Korea
Japan's just starting out http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/japan...ing-japan.html and http://www.hongkongcard.com/forum/fo...p?id=3939&p=17 #168 but there are no reports I know of where cardholders are compelled to use DCC against their will.
Korea is also not much affected by DCC but where offered, trying to opt out is harder than Japan due to the language barrier (both verbal and written)

Disabling DCC in Thailand and Taiwan
DCC present but generally not an issue. Cashier will generate quote slip is usually generated and pass to cardholder. When cardholder refuses, a verbage-free slip denominated in THB/TWD will be produced.
Certain Taiwan hotels may take deposits in cardholder currency. But these are only pre-authorisations and can be voided in full for TWD-only final checkout payments.

I got duped by DCC already before I found this thread.  Is there anything I can do?
If you've been hit with DCC and the merchant did not follow the Visa/MC rules, you should file a dispute with your card issuer. Even if the transaction is a small amount, it's worth it to dispute the charge on principle. Do not let merchants get away with this scam uncontested!
If you were not clearly given a choice of currencies and did not specifically communicate a preference to be billed in your card's native currency - if you did not accept DCC - then you have recourse when filing a dispute with your card issuer. The Visa Product and Service Rules clearly state (p 339):
Merchants that offer DCC must be compliant with the regulations
Inform the cardholder that DCC is optional
Not impose any additional requirements to use local currency
Not use any language or procedures that may cause the cardholder to choose DCC by default
Not convert a transaction in the local currency to the card's billing currency after the transaction has completed
Ensure that the cardholder expressly agrees to DCC
You can even use terminology from Visa Product and Service Rules when filing the dispute, giving Reason Code 76: Incorrect Currency or Transaction Code. Reason Code 76 is used when the transaction was processed with an incorrect transaction code, or an incorrect currency code, or one of the following:
Merchant did not deposit a transaction receipt in the country where the transaction occurred
Cardholder was not advised that Dynamic Currency Conversion (DCC) would occurCardholder was refused the choice of paying in the merchants local currencyMerchant processed a credit refund and did not process a reversal or adjustment within 30 calendar days for a transaction receipt processed in errorrules also clearly stateReason Code 4846MasterCard Chargeback GuideThe cardholder states that he or she was not given the opportunity to choose the desired currency in which the transactions was completed or did not agree to the currency of the transaction, or
POI currency conversion took place into a currency that is not the cardholder's billing currency, or
POI currency conversion took place when the goods or services were priced in the cardholder's billing currency, or
POI currency conversion took place when cash was disbursed in the cardholdeer's billing currency.
You do have a choice of currencies.  Exercise that choice!doVisa Exchange Rate CalculatorMasterCard's Currency Conversion ToolExample Images (click for a larger image)

			As someone who's been unwillingly hit with Dynamic Currency Conversion (DCC), I thought we could get a thread going talking about people's experiences and best practices to avoid getting an unwanted DCC charge when using our cards abroad.

			Just to be clear, DCC is not just a scam imposed on Americans by merchants outside the USA; it is international and is spreading like a cancer metastasizing through the travelling world.  American merchants pull the same scam with the same lies on visitors to our shores and their credit cards also charge foreign transaction fees on them.  When all is said and done, you may be paying up to 8% if victimized by this scam or agreeing with the philosophy that it is a service and good to know the exact value of something in a currency you understand.
Nice summary of dcc above.  Just one minor corrction.  A foeign transaction fee is imposed by many banks at least in the USA for purchases processed by a processor outside the USA.  Thus for example, if you buy Aer Lingus tickets from Orbitz over the internet in a transaction that never leaves the USA, you are still nicked for the foreign transacton fee as Orbitz transmit the charge to Aer Lingus which processes its mc and visa transaction through a processor in Ireland (no surprise there) which means bingo another 3% despite the fact it is a US based transactin all the way.
And just to be clear as noted above, if the merchant refuses to do a charge the proper way with one of the lies they have readilly available, do not offer to pay cash.  That is just rewarding them for their illegal attempt to derraud you.  Simply cross out the amount in your currency, write dcc refused and initial that.  Or if the merchant refuses to accept the charge sans your signature, just cross out the statement agreeing to be scammed and when you get home, dispute the charge.  As this is a clear violation of mc/visa procedures the charge should be charged back to the merchant although if it is a small amount the bank may simply absorb the difference which may seem trivial butit's the principle of the matter and the only way to combat this scam.
Finally when checking into a hotel and renting a car outside your naitive land, watch for the scam of them inserting a phrase into what you're signing agreeing to be scammed with dcc.   This can be difficult especially when they write this in the local language but it's one of the ways merchants, even some big time merchants such as Avis and Mariot, two companies who I know have pulled these shenanigans, have tried to pull this off.
This thread should be very good to hear the experiences of people being scammed by this monstrosity to help us all learn what we can do to avoid it.

Why not?  My most recent usage at a foreign ATM made it sound like the world would end if I didn't accept.  It took three prompts to reject it.

			The main culprit behind the international growth of DCC are Visa and MC. Both have been pushing merchants to buy into the practice. The argument is that a merchant using DCC is better than a merchant who doesn't accept plastic at all, but it remains entirely dishonest.Some cities/countries are worse than others. I lived in Italy and rarely saw DCC used (with the exception of hotels, which often ask... I'm looking at you, Westin Excelsior). A week in Dublin, though, was DCC central. Nearly every merchant, except Trinity's bookstore, tried to get me to use it. A coffee shop didn't give me a choice and a call to Chase got the difference refunded. I quickly learned to say "charge me in euros" as I would hand over my credit card.

I'm not sure mc/visa had much choice in this.  After all, they make substantial income on the 1% they charge for currency exchange transaction and I believe it's 0.8% or something for allowing acces to the international interchange system even if no currency exchange is involve.d.  It is or seems to be waiving of these fees is hardly ever done outside the USA and in the USA some do waive these fees, some pass along the fees and some of the near criminal banks impose an additional fee to bring it up to 3%.
But in any event, somewhere in the back of my warped mind there seems to have been some kind of agreement somewhere prohibiting mc/visa from prohibiting dcc as I remember.  Now why it wouldn't apply to Amex I can't answer (although most of the Amex cards have foreign exchange fees).  As far as discover, they really don't have all that much of an international presence.  I hear China all the time and that may be true but very few places in Europe, for example, still take Dincers Club where supposedly Discover is interchangeable with.  And aren't North American diners club cards processed through the mastercard system?  So I don't think mc/visa are the culprits here.

In China Discover is processed through UnionPay and is probably more widely accepted.  Similar to how it is processed through JCB in Japan. I have no idea what that means for DCC however.

Noted and logged.  But I've read all sorts of threads where in China, dcc is very much practiced.  So if using Discover in China, is one subjected to this scam?

Discover specifically warns to look for it in general.

I understand that its more than US cardholders traveling overseas, and that it has happened to people all over the world, including others getting hit with DCC from merchants in the US.  I will correct the wiki in a bit to reflect what you said, and you can feel free to edit it too.  Thats the benefit of a wiki!

Yep, I figured we could have a comprehensive thread on DCC, including both purchases at the point of sale as well as ATMs.  This way we can share information, best practices, and ways to look out for the tricks that merchants and ATM operators are now trying to pull.

I will answer with a definite maybe.  All I can tell you that when checking into my hotel in London last year with a chip and signature card, the clerk handed me the pin pad and the first thing it asked is which currency I wished to pay in, sterling or US dollars.  I assume that's the first thing that happens in a chip and pin transaction.  However, it is possible for certain dishonest merchants to push the "your currency" button before handing you the pin pad.  So the answer is a definite maybe.

It also won't help for transactions that don't require a verification method.  For instance, many times under $25, $50, or even $100 now at some merchants in the US you don't need to sign for a receipt.  If the point-of-sale terminal defaults to your card's denominated currency and the transaction completes without your interaction, you can get DCC without any authorization from you.

Don't Visa/MC require explicit authorization from the terminal?

			Haven't seen a thread discussing this, hope I'm not wrong. US Air card is up for renewal, any experiences in calling Barclay's to have the fee waived? Any special number to call?
Thx

 message 						They will probably offer you bonus miles for certain category purchases (e.g. one extra mile per dollar for groceries) for a few months.

			Had the USAir card for nearly 20 years. You'd think they would want to keep a long time card holder with high spends and great credit, right?  So I called to request a retention bonus; they offered 1k.  No thanks, I cancelled.  Now trying to figure out how long I need to wait to apply for a new one to get the sign up bonus. I have never tried churning a card before, so I'm clueless.

Most people in that thread report being able to get a second card while they still have the first card.  And many people in that thread have reported being able to get a new card within months (6 or maybe even 3?) after getting the previous card.
So, like at Citi, I'm not sure that "cancelling" has anything to do with it at Barclays/Juniper.  (Note:  Things are very fluid recently, and you may only be able to get a 35k rather than 40k bonus with no annual fee.  But it may depend on the exact hour you apply.  )  But anyway, all the latest data points are in that thread.
(Some banks care how long ago you last had the card, but others, like definitely Citi, only care how long ago you got your most recent card of that type, not whether you cancelled it or not.)

 message 						Thanks for that sdsearch.  It looks like I may be safer putting off that new application for a few months.  I recently jumped on the American Advantage card from citi for 50K... so that may be another reason to wait it out and just hope there are still some decent offers out there.

Annual Fee Posted Yesterday
 / icon and title 
 message 						I actually had no intention of cancelling this card as I want the 10k bonus miles and am willing to spend $89 to get them. However I decided to call anyway just to see if they would waive the fee (I did not threaten to cancel). The CSR transferred me to a specialist who answered in seconds (Calling on a Saturday is a good thing) and I was told they could not waive the annual fee because it had already posted. She did offer me 2,000 bonus miles for a single purchase within 90 days. I accepted. Next year (if the card is still around) I will be calling before the annual fee posts. Spend in 2012 was about $3750 ($1250/month/3 months for 15k) and I also used it for a 0% balance transfer offer.

I believe the rep. didn't tell you the truth about the annual fee. They could, and do, issue credits. Next time hang up and call back. My ann. fee will be posting in a few days & I'll cancel unless they waive the fee or give me at least 10K miles. The club pass also adds some value but not sure about the companion pass.

My ann. fee will be posting in a few days & I'll cancel unless they waive the fee or give me at least 10K miles. The club pass also adds some value but not sure about the companion pass.Note regarding my previous post above, I requested reinstatement of my account after having second thoughts.  Request was granted.Please post back here with your results. I've tried the "loyal longstanding high spend cardholder route" for a retention bonus and the best they offered was 1000 miles... I didn't even ask for a waiver of the annual fee! Heck, I don't even have the 10k at annual renewal bonus. Original World Elite benefits are hard to give up though.

I got the 2,000 plus the contractual 10k, so 12,000 miles for $89 fee. To me it was worth it.

 message 						I called in regarding mine (annual fee hits 3/31), and the CSR transfered me to a specialist. That specialist told me there were no offers to waive or retain, because the annual fee hadn't been charged yet, but encouraged me to call on 4/1, because they give a 60-day grace period in which you can cancel and get the AF refunded. So, I'll call on 4/1 and update what happens!

 message 						When I called I received a credit for half the annual fee ($44.50).  I did not have a lot of activity on the card, and none for the last six months.  Worth it for the 10K annual, and 5K savings on rewards.

Wow!  I tried that route a year ago and they offered nada. Just got a second card with the 35K bonus, so I'd be afraid to try that route with my World Elite this soon.  I'll try again in about four months though.  Thanks for that data point!

			I've wayyy too much credit limit than my total stated income. I feel like because of this banks are going to FR me...citi just did that. I'm curious if lowering credit limit might be a good way to go about it. 
I am sure it will slight hurt my credit score but the my major concern is: if I lower my credit limit across many cards in a short interval of time, will another bank flag me or something?  Like, is it seen as a bad thing? Should I lower credit slowly across several months just to be safe?

			How did you determine that you have way too much?  What your ratio of limits to income?  What issues have you run into because of those limits?
There's no way to determine if you have "way too much" until you actually run into it and not all creditors are going to consider "too much" to be the same amount for your credit profile.  I'd suggest not worrying over it until you actually run into it.  You can reduce limits when it's confirmed that it is an issue with a creditor.  Still, it's your call if you want to reduce your limits.
Impact all depends on how your Revolving Utilization is concerned.  You can do the math to determine how it would be impacted.  Revolving Utilization is simply balance(s) / limit(s).  If, for example, you have a $1,000 balance on a card with a $5,0000 limit that puts that card at 20% Revolving Utilization.  Drop the limit to $2,000 and you'd be at 50% with the same balance.  Keep in mind that 30% is a generally suggested maximum but that's far from ideal which is well under 10%.  Lower is better as long as you don't have all your revolving accounts reporting 0 balances.
Again, I'd suggest not fretting over it until it has been actually cited by a creditor.

Unlikely unless it increases your revolving utilization enough.  It's never just about limits or any one single factor on its own.  It all depends on your entire credit profile and income.
Further, different creditors and products have different underwriting criteria and risk tolerances.  We can't tell you for each creditor as we don't have such details and a broad, sweeping generalization won't mean anything.  It's all about how a specific given creditor would react.  It's impossible to give you the answer you're looking for -- especially with no information.

It doesn't really matter.  It's all about impact to Revolving Utilization, not time.

No offense - per your word, you are screwed anyway.
So I see no point that you should create another problem to lower your CLs.
In other words, if you get FRed again, so be it.

			I also think you are worrying needlessly.  Assuming you passed the Citi FR, they are obviously fine with where you are at.  Perhaps it was just a random audit that flagged you - none of us know the inner workings of their computer algorithms that can trigger these things.
Calling attention to yourself may be worse.  First you will likely have to deal with humans and I personally believe the fewer humans that look at my credit shenanigans, the better.  Who knows what they may think.  Perhaps they will conclude you are a reformed compulsive gambler worried about a relapse, so you want to limit the damage you can do to yourself.  They may think that since YOU think you can't handle the credit you have now, maybe you should not have any, or only 10% of what you have, or ????
It very well could affect other banks.  It was with increased limits, but Barclays definitely noticed my AOR about seven years ago and closed my two 0% BT cards once they saw the other $200K of credit show up on my report.  Never missed a payment and paid them back in full, but I'm still banned since they see me as a risk.
Bank A could get nervous if they see your lines at banks B & C get slashed.  I don't know if their algorithms actually watch for this, but if I was running a risk management program I would consider it.  If it's not broke, don't call attention to it.

Churnable to get repeated 5x rewards?
Not possible 
http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/22871522-post710.html
Update April 16 Still Not Churnable
http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/credi...l#post26511091
How to pay down CL quickly?
ACH push from other banks to wells fargo checking and then use that to pay credit card
Likely to get shut down if...?- Have a negative balance- Have a really high balance- Cycling several times through your CL
- Calling in and getting caught by human eyes for suspicious activities.
To check what your 5X/5% window is:
In the rewards account, go to My Rewards -> Account Activity and the days left on the promo will show up at the top....looks like a pie chart.
To check which transactions get 5X/5% before your statement posts 
Now, to check if new transactions are eligible for 5X before statement closes, go to "My Rewards" on the top and click "Activity" and set the start/end dates. You should see a "bonus earning" for 4% extra cash back for anything that's eligible.
Caps on 5x / 5%??
There are no more caps.
What to do when transaction not going through due to FA?
Human @ fraud prevention line is 877-575-0462 (to verify charges if locked out) (Update 3-3-15 - Phone number no longer in service per this post)
Automated response number was 800-446-0664

			If you are churning the 5x Wells Fargo card, be aware there's a 120K (calendar) yearly cap on rewards.
Don't be like me and discover you've just wasted $25K of churn. 
That said - this is a good churning card that hasn't been fully devalued like the PenFed card.  Yet.

I found this out about 10 days ago when my statement hit and I wasted about 7K in spend which is $55.3, I was pissed then I realized wells had already given me $1200 so I got over it.

 message 						When did this 5x go public?  The site says 3% until you click more details then it says 5x.  Does anyone know which credit agency they pull from?

			When you say good for churning, do you mean this is an easy card to cancel and get a new one with 5x, etc? Or are you simply saying churn with other cards.
The 120K limit would only use up about half of one month of my family BB cards so that would run out real quick. If it were churnable, then it may make sense to get a few of these for family members, rinse and repeat.Just did an AOR for 4 of us however, with 6 to 8 cards each, so will probably need to wait 5 months and see if it is still available. In the mean time 5x Carlson, 6x Hilton, and 4x Flexperks are pretty decent for grocery MS. 5x cash would be much better. We have a huge relationship with WF.

			I am waiting to apply in September for this 5x card due to this limit. 
Hopefully I can get 120K points in 2013 and then 120K in 2014

* 120K points at the 3% rate = $40K of spend
* Monthly limit = (2 * $40K) = $80K

 Why 3% if it is a 5x card?

Don't be like me and discover you've just wasted $25K of churn. 
That said - this is a good churning card that hasn't been fully devalued like the PenFed card.  Yet.
Is this for the Rewards version only?  The Home Rebate says "No limit to rebates" and the Cash one says, in the banner, unlimited cash rewards....

Btw, anyone had any experience churning these cards or holding multiple WF cards at the same time?

			It has been my experience with a Chase Visa (with, theoretically, no foreign exchange fee) that the exchange rate used would average less than 0.5% above the mid-rate quoted on xe.com. In the past few months, this has risen to over 1%. While you can argue various reasons why Visa's exchange rate might differ from other sources, including date of transaction vs date of posting, etc, for a single transaction, that's the average I'm seeing.
Comparing an IHG Mastercard gives me Chase MP Visa charging up to 1.27% more than the Mastercard for same-day same-currency transactions.It appears as though Chase/Visa has gradually instituted an effective 1% foreign exchange fee which doesn't occur on the Mastercard. Certainly makes the IHG card a lot more attractive.

 message 						Interesting. I was wondering about this subject. I live in Mexico about 80% of the year and have been using Chase SP and Ink depending on what the spend is. My Barclays US Air MC cards just began offering the no forex fee benefit. I guess I should make two identical purchases using a different card for each to see if the exchange rate is different.

 message 						I also want to chime in that the recent rates in Chase Sapphire prefered was terrible. And I had questioned Chase on the rate because I checked the rate visa published on their website and  Chase didn't use any of the visa rates whether it was day of spend or day of posting. It was ard 1% difference. Unfortunately Chase CSR was of no help and the difference I lost was only $20 USD so I didn't press any further. But now I have to be more careful and monitor for foreign spend.

I hadn't known Visa had its rates online. Interesting to compare.e.g. Last month USD vs AUD16th:xe.com: 0.819748oanda.com: 0.82025usa.visa.com: 0.829817 (roughly 1.1% above)17th:xe.com: 0.822350oanda.com: 0.82180
usa.visa.com: 0.825817 (roughly 0.5% above)
Looks like Mastercard is using a good mid-rate and Visa is adding from 0.5% upwards and then the Chase Visa rate tends to be even worse. It looks to me as though the differences are greatest when currencies are fluctuating, so I suspect Visa is picking the worst rate of the day to use.

Any examples of someone using the following kind of benchmark test: using four different "no-forex-fee" cards for back-to-back transactions at a particular non-US Starbucks or McDonalds and see what happens? Something akin to near simultaneous use of a Bank A Visa, a Bank A MasterCard, a Bank B Visa, and a Bank B MasterCard to see how it posts for a purchase of the same item.

			1. The date of purchase is irrelevant. Transactions are always priced when posted, but the rate used is not necessarily the rate established on the posting date. Read your card agreement to see what they use.
2. When you use a card denominated in USD to make a purchase in another currency you are instructing the issuer to purchase that currency on your behalf. You need to look at purchase rates, not fictitious mid-market rates which represent an average of buying and selling rates at an arbitrary time. (It is well established that the published daily fixes were illegally manipulated.) Foreign exchange markets never close, the transaction network can price whenever they choose, and I would expect them to do this in a way which maximizes their profit. I would like to think that competition between MasterCard and VISA would create an incentive for one to offer better rates than the other, but this has little marketing value for consumer cards because they cannot demonstrate a savings that is meaningful for individuals. It could be useful for wooing corporate clients.
3. If you think you have evidence that Chase is adding an undisclosed foreign transaction fee don't write about it here. Hire a lawyer because they are violating a binding explicit antitrust agreement not to do this.

I'm not sure why you think reading the card agreement is relevant. As you yourself point out, forex markets never close. Chase can list a transaction online initially with one value and then give it a different value when posted, even when it's posted on the same date. I dare say it's easier to compare the rate at purchase time to the published rates elsewhere at that instant than to compare the posting date rate with the rate at some arbitrary time of day.

Yet, somehow, Mastercard's rates are remarkably close to those "fictitious" mid-market rates.

As various comments demonstrate, it seems that it's Visa's doing. Also, whoever's it is, raising awareness and using Mastercard is free. Hiring a lawyer is not.

			Visa uses rates based on the previous day and settlement date. Look at the mid market rates for the previous date and it should be closer to the rate listed.I did some testing recently and it was about 50/50 which rate was better. MasterCard used to add a 1% hidden charge, but this was removed in 2013/2014 I believe.

The difference is marginal. I threw a bunch of my transactions from last quarter 2014 and all 2015 so far across 6 currencies into a spreadsheet to see how much more Visa was charging above the mid-rate on average:Visa vs XE: +.54%Visa vs XE prev. day: +.52%Visa vs XE 2014: +.41%Visa vs XE 2015: +.76%(c.f. MC vs XE 2015: -.06%)

			I didn't have time to say test it at various shops using different cards. But I had a hotel charged in jpy which I cancelled. It took many days for the cancellation to appear on my card. On the day of posting, I believe visa's rate published was 119.2, but chase had charged me 119.9. I thought visa's rate was already quite bad because usdjpy was trading mostly between 117-118 in between the days I had cancelled and the day it posted. Needless to say, I was quite pissed off. But given that the net difference was $10 USD I really didn't have the energy to fight over it. 
On another note, I do use my US cards in HK all the time, and the rates between visa/mastercard/amex were remarkly close in HK, given that USDHKD hardly moves and is a pegged currency.

 message 						I too have noticed that Visa Intl.'s rates are ~.5% above the mid-market. Which is way better than the 2.5%--3.5% of the bad old days before 'no-forex-fee' cards!

			Citi issues cards on three networks Here is Citi's explanation of how each network calculates exchange rates. Note that no network makes the conversion based on the transaction date. It is always tied to the posting date. See if there is a basis to choose one over another based on the processes rather than anecdotal reports or vague generalizations. 
Quote:							Information on Foreign Currency Conversion
Our network providers are MasterCard, Visa, and American Express. They convert transactions in foreign currencies into U.S. dollars. The type of card you have determines who does the conversion. Each network provider follows its own procedures. Each network providers current procedures are described below. The procedures may change from time to time without notice. 
 MasterCard uses a conversion rate in effect one day
before its transaction processing date. It uses agovernment-mandated rate if required to do so. If not,
it uses a wholesale market rate. Visa uses a conversion rate in effect on its applicablecentral processing date. It uses a government-mandatedrate if required to do so. If not, it selects from the rangeof rates available in wholesale currency markets. The
selected rate may vary from the rate Visa receives. American Express uses any conversion rate requiredby applicable law. If there is none, it uses the highestinterbank rate it selects on the business day before the
day it processes the transaction.

			Hi!
I'm hoping to book a flight with Norwegian Air later this year.
Is there a card that I could get which offers sign-up bonus points that I could use to book a flight on Norwegian?I thought that I read that the Capitol One Venture card would let you use your points for ANY travel related expense , i.e. flights, hotel, etc. but may have misunderstood this.

There are many cards which earn points which have a fixed monetary value when redeemed for travel. There are also cards which earn cash, which can of course be used to pay for travel. The cash cards offer maximum flexibility, but tend not to have competitive new account bonuses.
If you plan to buy the ticket directly from the airline be sure to research which card types they accept (American Express, Discover, MasterCard, VISA).

			Gotta wonder why OP wants specifically to fly Norwegian when he or she knows about points.  Wouldn't it be better to get a couple of cards with big bonuses on UAL or AA etc and use the bonus points to fly on the many different airlines available when you have such miles.  Or get a couple of Chase cards (INK and Sapphire Preferred, for example) and use the Ultimate Rewards points to transfer to one of the many available airlines.
Why does it have to be Norwegian?--why limit your options?

Norwegian is dirt cheap, like $200-300 one way LAX to London, while even in coach awards are 30k miles. So if you have this option and schedule works, it makes sense vs. regular airlines.

			Norwegian flies from Boston to Berlin for less than $400 round trip.
The reason I'm looking to use points is to make an already cheap flight even cheaper! Maybe even free.
Also, I'm trying to convince my friend's to go and if there's a card that will help them, I want to tell them about it.I would rather use Ultimate Rewards points on a more expensive trip. For example, to Japan.

Well, the problem is, the only points cards that will let you redeem for purchases on indie carriers like Norwegian are those "glorified" 2% (or less) cash back cards that masquerade as "travel points cards" because they limit you to redeeming for travel.  But it's still the same 2% cash back equivalent, whether you use a "travel points card" which can only redeemed for travel or if you use a "true" 2% cash back card like Citi Double Cash.
So the only way you are going to make it seem even cheaper is through the "smoke and mirrors" of one of these cards.  If you friend is already using a 2% cashback card, it'll be no cheaper at all, it'll just be a "diversion" of their cash back toward this trip, nothing more.Now, you may be able to get a little bit of signup bonus on one of those cares, but it's not nearly as much as with "real" miles cards or cards with "transferable" points (like Chase CSP for UR and equivalent cards for Amex MR and Citi TYP).

So now you have to consider the opportunity cost. If you use a generic travel rewards or cash back card in order to cover the cost of a trip on Norwegian, then you're earning that many fewer UR points for the future more expensive trip.

Bank Americard Travel Rewards + Preferred Rewards = Up to 2.775% everywhere card?

			Hello everyone,
I hesitate to post this as I have a lurking feeling this deal is too good to be true or last. Nevertheless, I just got approved for the Bank Americard Travel Rewards that earns 1.5x on everything when redeemed for flight, rental car, etc (similar to the BarclayCard Arrival).
In addition, I also opened a checking and savings at Bank of America, which automatically gives me a 10% annual bonus on points earned, bringing the rewards up to 1.65x. 
Finally, with enough deposits, Bank of America offers 3 tiers of "Preferred Rewards" accounts, which results in an additional bonus on points earned. I've listed the tiers and hypothetical rewards below:
>$20k: 25% bonus meaning: 1.5 * 1.25 + 0.15(the 10% annual bonus) = 2.025x
>$50k: 50% bonus = similar math to above = 2.4x
>$100k: 75% bonus = 2.775x
I do realize many will not want to tie up between $20k and $100k at Bank of America but you can choose to hold your deposits in a Merrill EDGE self-directed investment account. As I like to keep a portion of my liquidity in the markets I will be going for the 75% bonus on credit card rewards.
So if I have my math right, it results in a 2.775x card with no annual fee, no foreign transaction fee, and an EMV chip to boot. This sounds too good to be true so I am asking the fine people of flyertalk to share their experiences with this card and perhaps shed light upon what I have overlooked.
UPDATE:

The "preferred rewards" program seems to be in it's infancy, and it's currently not available nationally so I'll share any strange experiences I have using this card. Thanks!

Very interesting rewards program.  So far just for people who live in KS, MO, NV, SC and WA it seems.
In NV and WA the Marukai Premium JCB card (~3% on all spending) still wins IMO.

Thanks for the clarification! I live in WA so that explains alot.
Definitely agree about the JCB card for the rewards. I actually looked into this after reading your post but my job sees me moving to Canada for a few years where acceptance is supremely spotty.

10% not stacked
 / icon and title 
 message 						According to the BoA terms and conditions, the 75% replaces the 10%, so these bonuses are not stacked as suggested in the above post.  Thus, with the 1.5 points/$1 travel card, you earn 2.625 points.  Still a nice deal, though.

BofA Cash Rewards 3.5% on Groceries and 5.25% on Gas
 / icon and title 
 message 						I was comparing the Travel card and the Cash Rewards cards and the combination of the 2 would be best.  Cash cash gives 2% on Groceries and 3% on Gas - the top tier gives 75% bonus for total of 3.5% and 5.25%.  Use the Travel card for everything at 2.65%.

Yes, but this card has a cap of the first $1,500 in combined grocery store and gas purchases each quarter. Can't really be scaled for MS.

 message 						Penny wise and pound foolish. Tying up $100000 in funds in a Merrill Lynch account compared to keeping it in a Vanguard low expense index fund/ETF will cost you dearly to earn that extra 0.65%. Better to stick to the FIA Amex or Barclay Arrival instead. How much spend (MS or real) do you plan to do on this card anyways?

You get up to 100 free trades per month depending on the Preferred Rewards tier.

Well that assumes you can't have Vanguard low expense index funds in your Merrill Lynch (ML) account. Not sure if it is still possible to purchase vanguard funds if you didn't previously hold them, but I know those who purchased Vanguard funds previously are still able to keep and add money via automatic investments to their Vanguard mutual funds in a ML brokerage account.

There's absolutely no reason tahat you couldn't buy Vanguard ETFs in your Merrill Edge account. In fact, you'd even buy them with no transaction fee. You'd actually be saving Vanguard $$ by not having them service the account.

It was $1000 a few days ago. Looks like they reduced it.

			Charles Schwab ATM-only card
Does Schwab issue a separate ATM-only card that has a different number than the debit card?
If not, what is the minimum POS limit that can be placed on a Schwab debit card for use at ATMs only?

I don't think that's OP's primary concern. It's more the fact that PIN is actually optional for POS purchases, meaning that if the magstripe's skimmed a thief can fairly quickly clean out one's account. (Correct me if I'm wrong.) It won't be as much of a concern as chip becomes more commonly used in the US.
Personally, my debit cards for the most part only see use in bank-owned ATMs. On top of that, I make sure to use ATMs inside or attached to a bank branch if possible. I've never had problems by following that rule of thumb.

Personally, my debit cards for the most part only see use in bank-owned ATMs. On top of that, I make sure to use ATMs inside or attached to a bank branch if possible. I've never had problems by following that rule of thumb.Schwab only offers a chip-enabled debit card that can be used for POS purchases and ATM withdrawals. The chip makes card cloning much harder if not impossible. And FYI, card skimming can also happen at bank-owned ATMs even at those attached to branches. That is more of a problem abroad. You just have to learn how to tell if there's an unauthorized device attached to the ATM. At any rate, you're not responsible for unauthorized charges so there isn't much to worry about.

Mainly because the US is the last country to bother with the whole chip thing. Otherwise that route would be far less viable for thieves.
Anyway, this might be of interest to some: http://krebsonsecurity.com/all-about-skimmers/

There are three services to pay your federal taxes:
pay1040.com 1.87% fee on credit
payUSAtax.com - 1.99% fee on credit
Officialpayments.com/fed - 2.25% fee on credit.  
In general, you're allowed 2 payments per processor above per type of tax (annual and quarterlies being 2 different types, for example).  They're not billed as cash advance fees.  If 6 payments is not enough to pay your bill you can use a service such as plastiq (2.25% fee).  If making multiple payments, it is advised you join here to track your payments link , you will be required to give your banking information and will receive a pin via snail mail
In general, you can only deduct the fee personally (S-Corp pass through) as a miscellaneous itemized deduction, but only miscellaneous expenses that exceed 2% of AGI are deductible. For a C-Corp the expense is fully deductible.  The majority of people will not be able to deduct that expense, check with your accountant.    
When making multiple payments at or near your credit limit multiple times, allow yourself 3-5 days between payments for the charge to show up on your card and your bank payment to clear.

			Previous discussion of this topic is in this thread:
Paying USA income, property or other taxes with CC. [2010-2012]
The thread has been split because there are new developments for paying taxes in 2013 using (for example) American Express Bluebird account, and some credit card processors have lowered their fees (see post 17).

Wouldn't it be ok to set the US Treasury as the payee and have it mailed directly to them?

Well it would be a paper check and I'm not super confident the IRS will properly credit me without a payment slip. Should I be concerned?

 message 						Officialpayments.com just accpted my JCB Marukai Premium California card for payment of California estimated income tax.  I have not tried Federal.  This particular card pays ~3%, but is only issued to residents of a few Western US states, and often with a low credit limit.

Officialpayments phone support let me make about a dozen or so payments through their phone support (visa gift cards at their debit card rate) and didn't indicate that there was a limit.  In comparison, I could not get through to payusatax phone support.  I explained to the officialpayments representative that I was calling because I had hit the online limit and she confirmed that she could process additional payments.   The representative was very cooperative when I told her that every detail of the payments would be same except for the last eight digits of the card.  She did have to reenter stuff with every payment, but all I had to do was give her the last eight digits of each card and say "yes" at various points when she had to read the details of each payment to me.  She gave me a separate confirmation number for each payment.
That said, I got a phone call an hour or so ago from officialpayments telling me that they were voiding another federal tax payment I did in that phone call with my Marukai JCB card, for which I had been issued a confirmation number.  I asked what about the California tax payment I had made a few days earlier with that card, and she told me she'd call back.Mentioning the California tax payment with my JCB card was definitely a double edged sword, but these were just test payments, and I'd rather have a more certain answer to report.  I plan to post an update on the JCB issue when I have more information.

			Skynerd, thanks for that report.  This may be a good way to go for paying a large federal tax bill.
Has anyone tried using a My Vanilla Debit to pay taxes?  It should work at the debit card rate, but I'm wondering if there's a daily limit or transaction limit for each charge.

Giving credit where it's due, I think I first read about officialpayments charging the debit card rate for Vanilla Visa gift cards and allowing more than 2 payments by phone support on the frequentmiler blog.  I have not tried that reloadable Vanilla card, which I think is what you're referring to.

			I received a second call from officialpayments just now.  My California tax payment on my JCB card was accepted even though my federal tax payment on the same card was rejected.  The phone rep said that the issue with JCB cards rejecting federal tax payments has been going on for a long time, but she doesn't recall a rejection of a California tax payments.  It is worth noting that their web site has (had?) different rules for California tax payments: the minimum fee is $1 instead of $3.95 and all payments are processed as credit card payments.  So, maybe JCB with officialpayments really does work for California and not federal.
I was also told that officialpayments rolled out a big software upgrade for the new year.  Now their web site does not ask you what kind of credit card you are using for federal payments.  It just infers it from your card number.  When I put in a vanilla visa card number, it offered me the debit card rate.  When I put in my JCB card number, it correctly described it as "Discover Network."  So, there is a remote chance that maybe federal payments will work with JCB on officialpayments now.
The officialpayments California web pages appear unchanged, by the way.

Easiest way, by far, to not end up with an orphaned balance.
This is a good idea.  Obvious perhaps, but I must admit it didn't occour to me.

 message 						Well, I paid my half year property taxes today using plain old Vanilla Visa gift cards.  I had to do multiple transactions of $496.05 + $3.95 debit fee each time to liquidate each $500 card, but the fees still came out much lower than paying the normal CC fee which is 2.35%.  As always since each municipality presumably uses a different form of online merchant processing YMMV, but it's good to know for some payment systems just a plan old off-the-shelf Vanilla card will do the trick.

			Can't get this to work in Los Angeles county (re: property taxes).If anyone knows how to get this to work in LA County... please let me know the trick.  My issue is that the installments are all over the max amount on the debit card, so making an automated payment via phone or online wouldn't be enough.

I'm going to try paying state estimated taxes first.  I entered a payment to my state (California Franchise Tax Board) on Jan 5th and had the check mailed to me at my home address with my name and address on it.  Received the check Jan 10th.  I'll photocopy it and send it along with the payment stub plus a personal check for the remaining balance of the payment due when I mail my 4th quater estimated tax on Jan 15th.
This oughta work....  And I see no reason why the same approach would not work with Federal estimates.
The limitation is that Bluebird would not let me write a check for more than $5000.  So if your state or federal estimate is higher than that, you'd either have to do this over several months or pay the balance by some other means.

This may not be the answer you're looking for, but what about logging on and making a maximum payment every day until your bill is paid? Is the service fee too high to make this work daily for several days? Where does it state that you can not make daily payments as long as the total is paid on or before the due date?

			I see the AAA Travel card has 3X points on travel, 2X on gas/grocery/drugstores and 1X on rest. If this can be combined with Platinum honors preffered status, will it not be travel (5.25%), G/G/D (3.5%) and 1.75% on rest?
Is it not better than Travel rewards card even though this card has several inclusions defined for travel category?
What am I missing?
Thanks

			It is included, but you only get the bonus on the 'base point', for some nonsense reason. So if you have the highest tier, it's 3.75/2.75/1.75 instead of what you posted. Also has a 2% FTF.
Quote:							Bank of America Preferred Rewards clients earn an additional 25% to 75% rewards bonus on every purchase, applied to the base earn of 1 point per $1.

Thanks. Based on my last 2 years summary, Travel Rewards is better for me.

A very generous travel card
 / icon and title 
 message 
			
			Below is more information as taken from http://midatlantic.aaa.com/memberrewardsvisapopup
There appear to be more than one application, and ones through AAA sites appear to include the $50 gift card bonus after spending $250.  I did not see this on the application from the BOA site. However, the BOA site ads do not refer to their Preferred Rewards program which can make this card 3.75% on travel if you qualify, which makes this a valuable card. It appears both ads refer to the same card, so it may pay to apply through an application on an AAA site.
The advertising is directed at AAA members and emphasizes the ability to redeem for their vouchers, a feature that may be of limited value if you are not a member.
However, near the end of this description is a statement that redemptions for cash or statement credits are possible. the wording is "The current redemption value for cash rewards check or deposits into a checking or savings account is 1% of the amount of the points redeemed." This implies that this feature may be changed (most likely in a downwards direction).
If, as indicated, the points can be transferred to a Fidelity American Express it may be possible to cash out with less than 5000 points.
You may also want to not the inclusions through Sep.1 of Commuter Transport/Ferries and Passenger Railways (MCC 4111 and 4112), which could be valuable for those in big cities who make heavy use of qualifying mass transit.

A Better AAA BOA Visa card
 / icon and title 
 message 
			
			Update:
If you go to the BOA website under points cards, there is a AAA Member Reward cards with a $100 bonus and essentially the same terms, with a clear statement it qualifies for Preferred Rewards. 
"Get more membership value and earn 3 AAA Member Rewards Points per $1 on all qualifying AAA and travel purchases
    Earn 3 points per $1 on qualifying AAA and travel purchases
    Earn 2 points per $1 on gas, grocery and drug store purchases
    Earn 1 point per $1 on all other purchases
    $100 statement credit after qualifying purchase(s)"
"You will qualify for a $100 statement credit if you use your new credit card account to make any combination of Purchase transactions totaling at least $250 (exclusive of any fees, returns and adjustments) that post to your account within 90 days of the account open date. "
The points earned are World Points and apparently can be transferred among World Point cards. You can exchange World Points for AAA products worth more than one cent per point. If an AAA member, this could be valuable since possible uses include vouchers exchangeable for car repairs (at a good price that is a saving over getting cash, and then paying cash). 
This may be a better deal than the card I discussed above, since $100 in cash beats a $50 gift card, and most terms otherwise appear the same. 
One way they are not the same is that the other version includes commuter rail and several other items in transportation till Sep. 1, and this could be valuable to some who spend heavily in these categories. I am not an AAA member so I cannot speak as to exactly how valuable the points are when used this way, but it appears good enough so being able to use them might justify joining AAA. Advice and discussion would be appreciated.

 message 						Also note the inclusion of drugstores at 2%. If you have Platinum Honors status this rises to at least 2.75%, which is better than you get with many cards, at least on a year around basis (the quarterly bonuses on many cards may include drug stores in some quarters).

At most 2.75%. You only get the bonus on the 'base point', so you get 1.75 (with top tier PR) + 1.
The Travel Rewards (at top tier of PR) gives you 2.63% on everything so if you don't have a bunch of travel expenses, it isn't worth carrying the other card, since the AAA card only gives you 1.75 on unbonused spend with the top tier of PR.

			I noticed one advantage of this card. You can redeem for cash with 5,000 World Points while many World Points cards will give 1 cent per point only with $250 worth. Since points transfer, this provides a way to redeem points for cash that were earned on other cards.

AAA vouchers?
 / icon and title 
 message 						I still do not know if the redemption opportunities through AAA products are worth much, but having this card does make such redemptions possible (even if the points were earned on other cards). It appears a car repair voucher redemption is worth more than a cent per point, but I suspect an AAA membership is needed to realize this. Does anyone know?

			Does anyone know if Expedia, Orbitz, and/or Travelocity qualify for 3X points for $1 travel spend?
I am thinking about getting this card.  I am a AAA member but do not bank with BoA...so Platinum Rewards bonus is out.  I like the idea of getting 3% cashback for spend on airfare, car rentals, and hotels.  From what I read on BoA's site, it looks like purchases directly from travel providers count as well as travel agencies count towards the 3X points, (which equals 3% cashback)...but I am not sure if that includes OTA's.
Any clarity would be greatly appreciated!

			Huh? There is no 3% cashback for travel purchases on either of these cards.Without the rewards bonuses, the Citi Double Cash is a better card for pure cashback (2% on everything.)

BoA AAA says 3x on AAA and travel purchase

T&C is a little confusing though, due to the placing of the comma.... does this mean we have to go through AAA portal to purchase (probably not)
Quote:Earn 3 points per dollar (consisting of 2 bonus points and 1 base point) for Net Purchases made with the card through any participating AAA Club, when AAA is the merchant of record or at eligible retail travel merchants. Eligible travel merchants include: (a) Airlines (individual major airline carriers, Airlines/Air Carriers); (b) Car Rental Agencies (individual major agencies and Automobile Rental Agencies); (c) Hotels, Motels, Inns and Resorts (individual major hotel/motel chains and Hotels/Motels/Resorts); (d) Steamship/Cruise Lines, and (e) Travel Agencies. AAA clubs located in Northern California, Nevada and Utah are not participating AAA Clubs and purchases made at those clubs will not earn triple points. In addition, the following types of transactions will not earn triple points: rail purchases of any kind; insurance purchases made through any AAA Club or Club-affiliated insurance agency for policies which are not underwritten by an insurance company owned by or affiliated with a AAA Club; and automobile extended warranties, trip insurance or any other services that are purchased through a participating AAA Club but are provided by a third party merchant. Merchants are assigned a merchant category code (MCC) based upon the merchant's primary line of business.

 Beginning Async AdSlot 14 for Ad unit ### size: [[300,250]]

 End AdSlot 14			Ugh, brain fart. Sorry, I thought this was the Travel Rewards thread.Hotels.com does count for the 3% on the AAA card, but I haven't tried with any other OTA.
